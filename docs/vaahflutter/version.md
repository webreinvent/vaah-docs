::: danger requirements
We try to use the latest stable version released by flutter, thus as of now VaahFlutter depends on dart SDK version 2.19.2 and flutter version 3.7.3

The `root/pubspec.yaml` file contains `sdk` and `flutter` properties which are used to define dart sdk and flutter versions.
- sdk: ">=2.19.2"
- flutter: ">=3.7.3"
