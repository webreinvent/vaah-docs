::: danger requirements
We try to use the latest stable version released by flutter, thus as of now VaahFlutter depends on dart sdk version 2.18.2 and flutter version 3.3.4

`root/pubspec.yaml` file contains `sdk` and `flutter` properties which are used to define dart sdk and flutter versions.
- sdk: '>=2.18.2'
- flutter: ">=3.3.4"
