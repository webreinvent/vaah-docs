# Lib

[[toc]]

## What is this directory about

All your app code will reside in the lib folder. Make sure to plan your code structure before starting to develop your app. Otherwise, it can get confusing quickly without proper organization.

This is the most important folder in the project, used to write most of the dart code. By default, the lib folder contains the main.dart file, which is the application’s entry point, in case of multiple environments lib can have multi main files.
