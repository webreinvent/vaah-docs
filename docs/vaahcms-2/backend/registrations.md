# Registrations

Registration and authentication are mandatory in any application when you have little concern about privacy.


## Purpose 

In VaahCms, the purpose of `Registration` is to prevent `duplicate` entries in `Users` table.

`Registration` page will display the all valid `Users` and a form to create and update the `Users`.

- Create New `User`
- Edit/Update the details of already exists `Users`.
- Deleting exists `Users`.
- Deleting temporary/Trashing already exists `Users`.
- List All existing `Users`.
- Filtering the `Users` list by searching using different `fields`. 
- Filtering the `Users` list by different status, trashed `Users`.
- Sorting the `Users` with ascending/descending order.
- Clone the `User` details. 
- Autofill the `User` field.
- Bulk Actions to status change,trash,delete

## Permission

Permissions allow users to access certain features of a course or project site, depending on their roles, and on the decisions made by the site owner and the system administrator. The ability to do actions on your site (including viewing content, editing content, and changing configuration) is governed by permissions. Each permission has a name (such as View published content) and covers one action or a small subset of actions.
