## Purpose
Permissions allow users to access certain features of a course or project site, depending on their roles, and on the decisions made by the site owner and the system administrator. The ability to do actions on your site (including viewing content, editing content, and changing configuration) is governed by permissions. Each permission has a name (such as View published content) and covers one action or a small subset of actions.
