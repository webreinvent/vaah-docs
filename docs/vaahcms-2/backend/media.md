# Media

Media Section is a collection of your image, audio, and Flash files used to enhance your website. Media Section can also generate all sorts of conversions. Using the blog post example, you probably don't want to display the original image in a list of blog posts. It's more likely that you want to show a thumbnail, on such a list.
