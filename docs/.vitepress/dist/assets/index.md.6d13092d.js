A list of functionality are following:</p><ul><li>Wordpress like installation</li><li>Extremely fast control/admin panel</li><li>Extend control/admin panel with no major learning curve</li><li>Roles &amp; Permissions</li><li>Install prebuilt modules &amp; themes</li><li>Modules: Build purpose specific isolated code</li><li>Themes: Create frontend themes</li><li><strong>VaahCLI:</strong> a CLI tool to generate modules and themes</li></ul><h2 id="requirements"><a class="header-anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Requirements</h2><h3 id="minimum-system-requirements"><a class="header-anchor" href="#minimum-system-requirements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Minimum System Requirements</h3><p>The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. All of these requirements are satisfied by the <a href="https://vaah.dev/cms/docs/requirements#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laravel Homestead</a> virtual machine, so it&#39;s highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.</p><p>However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:</p><ul><li>PHP &gt;= 7.4</li><li>BCMath PHP Extension</li><li>Ctype PHP Extension</li><li>JSON PHP Extension</li><li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li><li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li><li>PDO PHP Extension</li><li>Tokenizer PHP Extension</li><li>XML PHP Extension</li></ul><h3 id="learning-curve"><a class="header-anchor" href="#learning-curve" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Learning Curve</h3><p>If you want to quickly get started with VaahCMS, all you need to know is <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laravel</a>. Please go through detailed documentation on Laravel official website.</p><p>But if you want to use the true potential of VaahCMS and want to develop enterprise level applications, then you must learn following technologies:</p><ul><li><a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue</a>: Vue.js is an open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Far more popular then reactjs, angularjs or emberjs.</li><li><a href="https://router.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue Router</a>: Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js. It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze.</li><li><a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vuex</a>: Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.</li><li><a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a>: Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 200,000 developers.</li><li><a href="https://buefy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buefy</a>: Lightweight UI components for Vue.js based on Bulma.</li></ul><p>You might ask why we went with <strong>Bulma instead of Bootstrap</strong> which seems much more popular. Well, that&#39;s because Bootstrap require JavaScript library and additional configuration to make it work with VueJs while Bulma is pure CSS framework.</p><h2 id="releases"><a class="header-anchor" href="#releases" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Releases</h2><h3 id="versioning-scheme"><a class="header-anchor" href="#versioning-scheme" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Versioning Scheme</h3><p>VaahCMS and its other first-party packages follow Semantic Versioning.
