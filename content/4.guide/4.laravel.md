# Laravel

## Introduction

This is a guide to maintain a consistent and industry stand code in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

## How to Debug

###### Important things you should  know when you are deal with Laravel.

I make this documentation to save your debugging time and you can easily find the common error.

* If you are getting errors when you store something in the database maybe you declare the wrong input field or store the data in the wrong table `laravel.log` file  helps you and  provides you the detailed error messages.

* You can access the `laravel.log` file in the following directory.
   
```
your_laravel_folder>storage>logs>laravel.log
```

* Sometimes the `laravel.log` does not generate the real-time error this following command helps you to generate the error in real-time in the `laravel.log` file.
```
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear
```


* Ensure that `error display settings` in your Laravel application are properly configured for development. you can do this using the following step in your laravel folder go to `config>app.php` file.
```
'debug' => env('APP_DEBUG', true),  // it is false bydefault make this true
```

* You can also get the real-time error in your terminal if you using `git bash`
install git first then Use the `cd`  command to navigate to your Laravel project's log directory
example here is my directory command:-

```
cd /d/projects/xampp811/htdocs/VueTest/LaravelBackend/storage/logs
and then when you are in the log use this command
tail -f laravel.log
```

* When you read the `laravel.log` file to resolve the error in log file the error is generated with data and time may be the date is corrected printed but the time may be wrong you can fix this issue by going to this folder `config>app.php`

```
'timezone' =>'Asia/Kolkata', //use this
 After this save your file.
```



## Laravel Routes

- Meaningful / Predictable
- All small letter
- 2 words must be joined with `hyphen` (`-`)

This is an example of for `articles`

## CRUD Routes

### HTML listing page

```http request
GET /articles/index
Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
Controller-Method: ArticleController@index
Model-Method: ""
```

### Listing
```http request
GET /articles
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getList
Model-Method: Article::getList
```

### Create one or many records
```http request
POST /articles
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@createList
Model-Method: Article::createList
```

If an array is passed, multiple records will be created or else single record will be
created.

Eg: Single Record
```php
$inputs = [
  "first_name" => 'John'
  "last_name" => 'Leo'
]
```

Eg: Multiple Records

```php
$inputs = [
  [
  "first_name" => 'John'
  "last_name" => 'Leo'
  ],
  [
  "first_name" => 'David'
  "last_name" => 'Leo'
  ]
]
```



### Bulk Update (eg: bulk status change)
```http request
PUT /articles
PATCH /articles
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@updateList
Model-Method: Article::updateList
```

### Bulk Delete
```http request
DELETE /articles
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@deteleList
Model-Method: Article::deteleList
```




### Read a record
```http request
GET /articles/1
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getItem
Model-Method: Article::getItem
```

### Update a record (update, soft delete, status change etc)
```http request
PUT /articles/1
PATCH /articles/1
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@updateItem
Model-Method: Article::updateItem
```

### Delete a record (hard deleted)
```http request
DELETE /articles/1
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@deteleItem
Model-Method: Article::deteleItem
```

### Fetch a relation of a record
```http request
GET /articles/1/relationships/author
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getItemAuthor
Model-Method: Article::getItemAuthor
```

### Attach a relation to a record
```http request
POST /articles/1/relationships/author
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@attachItemAuthor
Model-Method: Article::attachItemAuthor
```

### Update a relation to a record
```http request
PUT /articles/1/relationships/author
PATCH /articles/1/relationships/author
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@updateItemAuthor
Model-Method: Article::updateItemAuthor
```

### Delete a relation to a record
```http request
DELETE /articles/1/relationships/author
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@deleteItemAuthor
Model-Method: Article::deleteItemAuthor
```

### Fetch list of relations
```http request
GET /articles/1/relationships/comments
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getItemComments
Model-Method: Article::getItemComments
```

### Update list of relations
```http request
PUT /articles/1/relationships/comments
PATCH /articles/1/relationships/comments
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@updateItemComments
Model-Method: Article::updateItemComments
```

### Delete list of relations
```http request
DELETE /articles/1/relationships/comments
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@deleteItemComments
Model-Method: Article::deleteItemComments
```

### Include relations
```http request
GET /articles?include=comments
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getList
Model-Method: Article::getList
```

### Include relation's relations
```http request
GET /articles?include=comments.created_by
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getList
Model-Method: Article::getList
```

### Sorting
```http request
GET /articles?sort=title,created_by
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getList
Model-Method: Article::getList
```

###### Sorting in descending order of `created_by`, use `:desc` in front of parameter
```http request
GET /articles?sort=title,created_by:desc
Content-Type: application/json
Controller-Method: ArticleController@getList
Model-Method: Article::getList
```
  
## Performance Tuning SQL Queries

SQL tuning is the process of improving SQL queries to accelerate your servers performance.
It's general purpose is to reduce the amount of time it takes a user to 
receive a result after issuing a query, and to reduce the amount of 
resources used to process a query. 

Big SQL queries can suffer performance issues. 
Performance degradation often occurs if the database is not being properly 
maintained or if queries can be rewritten more efficiently.

Following Query optimization tips for better performance

#### Apply Index On Necessary Columns:

Table indexes in databases help retrieve information faster and more efficiently.
An index creates a unique data column without overlapping each other. 
It improves the speed of data retrieval.

#### Avoid Query In A Loop:
 
 If sometimes we need to execute the same query multiple times like if 
 we need to insert 10 records in any table at that time don’t use 
 insert query in the loop instead of using bulk insert.
 
 We shouldn't call Eloquent relationships method in loop. 
 First convert model object in to collection and then pass in to loop.
 
  
**Wrong Examples:**

```php
public function category()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Category::class,
         'catgeory_id', 'id'
    );
}
 
 
public function getList()
{

    $products = Product::with(['catgory'])->all();

    foreach ($products as $key => $product)
    {

        if($product && $product->category){

        }
    
    }

}
    
```
 
**Correct Examples:**
```php

public function category()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Category::class,
        'catgeory_id', 'id'
    );
}
     
public function getList()
{

    $products = Product::with(['catgory'])->all();
    
    $collect_products = collect($products);
    
    foreach ($collect_products as $key => $product)
    {
        if($product && $product->category){

        }
    }

}

```
 

#### Avoid too many JOINs:

When you add multiple tables to a query and join them, you may overload it. 
In addition, a large number of tables to retrieve data from may result in an 
inefficient execution plan. When generating a plan, the SQL query optimizer 
needs to identify how the tables are joined, in which order, how and when to 
apply filters and aggregation.

JOIN elimination is one of the many techniques to achieve efficient query plans. 
You can split a single query into several separate queries which can later be joined, 
and thus remove unnecessary joins, subqueries, tables, etc.

#### Use SELECT fields instead of retrieve all data:

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the database. 
In the case of large databases, it is not recommended to retrieve all data 
because this will take more resources on querying a huge volume of data.


If we execute the following query, we will retrieve all data from the Users table, 
including, for example, users’ avatar pictures. The result table will contain 
lots of data and will take too much memory and CPU usage.

**BAD CODE**

 ```php
 
User::get();
    
 ```
 
 Instead, you can specify the exact columns you need to get data from, thus, 
 saving database resources. In this case, SQL Server will retrieve only the 
 required data, and the query will have lower cost.
 
 **GOOD CODE**
 
  ```php
  
 User::select('first_name','last_name','email')->get();
     
  ```

#### Use Exists instead of First or Count in condition :

Instead of using the count method to determine if any records exist that 
match your query's constraints, you may use the `exists` and `doesntExist` methods.

It depends if you want to work with the user afterwards or only check if one exists.

If you want to use the user object if it exists:


 ```php
 
$user = User::where('email', '=', Input::get('email'))->first();
if ($user === null) {
   // user doesn't exist
}
    
 ```
 
And if you only want to check

 ```php
 
if (User::where('email', '=', Input::get('email'))->count() > 0) {
    // user found
}
    
 ```
 
Or even nicer

 ```php
 
if (User::where('email', '=', Input::get('email'))->exists()) {
   // user found
}
    
 ```


## Query Operators

|MySql Operator| Query Parameter | Purpose |
|--|--|--|
|=|eq| Equal to
|!=|not| Not equal to
|<|lt| Less than
|<=|lte| Less than or equal to
|>|gt| Greater than
|>=|gte| Greater than or equal to
|like|like|  Like search query
|between|btw|  Between

## API Routes

GET /api/articles
```

### Specify page number

```http request
GET /api/articles?page=5
```

### Limit the results
```http request
GET /api/articles?limit=10
```


### Sort By ascending order of title then created_by

GET /api/articles?sort=title,created_by
```

### Sort By in ascending order of title then descending order created_by
```http request
GET /api/articles?sort=title,created_by:desc,price
```

### Include comment in the article (relationship)
```http request
GET /api/articles?include=comments
```

## Laravel Community Guidelines for Good Coding Practices

### Shorter and readable syntax

- Use shorter and more readable syntax where possible

**Bad Examples**
```php
$request->session()->get('cart');
$request->input('name');
```

**Good Example**
```php 
session('cart');
$request->name;
```

**More Examples**    
|Common syntax | Shorter and more readable syntax |  
|:--|:--|  
|Session::get('cart') | session('cart') |  
|$request->session()->get('cart') |  session('cart') |
|Session::put('cart', $data)  |  session(['cart' => $data]) |  
|$request->input('name'), Request::get('name') | $request->name, request('name') |
|return Redirect::back()  |  return back() |
|is_null($object->relation) ? null : $object->relation->id | optional($object->relation)->id |  
|return view('index')->with('title', $title)->with('client', $client) |  return view('index', compact('title', 'client')) |  
|$request->has('value') ? $request->value : 'default'; | $request->get('value', 'default') |
|Carbon::now(), Carbon::today() | now(), today() |
|App::make('Class') | app('Class') |
|->where('column', '=', 1) | ->where('column', 1) |
|->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')  |  ->latest() |  
|->orderBy('age', 'desc')  | ->latest('age') |
|->orderBy('created_at', 'asc') | ->oldest() |
|->select('id', 'name')->get() | ->get(['id', 'name']) |
|->first()->name  |  ->value('name') |

### Avoid Fat Methods
- Avoid fat controllers and write frequent queries in model.
- DB related logic should be in `Eloquent models` or in `Repository`/`Helper` classes.
- Do not include business logic in Controllers. They should be in `Repository`/`Helper` classes.
- Methods and Classes should adhere to the `Single Responsibility Principle`.
- Don't use extensive if-else nesting. Instead, check for negative conditions first.
- Do not keep commented code in methods or classes.

**Bad Examples**
```php 
public static function getItem($id)
{
    
    if(!Auth::user()->hasPermission('hrc-can-read-customers')
        && !EqCustomerUser::hasPermission(\Auth::user(),'hrc-can-read-customers')) // check Permissions
    {
        if(Auth::user()){
            $item = self::where('id', $id)
            ->withTrashed()
            ->first();
    
    
            $response['status'] = 'success';
            $response['data'] = $item;
        
            return $response;
        }
        else{
            $response['status'] = 'failed';
            $response['errors'][] = 'User not found';
    
            return $response;
        }
    }
    else{
        $response['status'] = 'failed';
        $response['errors'][] = trans("vaahcms::messages.permission_denied");
        return $response;
    }
    
    // $user = Auth::user();
    // if(!$user) {
    //    $response['status'] = 'failed';
    //    $response['errors'][] = 'User not found';
    //
    //    return $response;
    // }

}

```


**Good Examples**
```php 
// Add this method to Helper/Repository class
public static checkPermission($permission_slug){
    if(!Auth::user()->hasPermission('hrc-can-read-customers')){
        $response['status'] = 'failed';
        $response['errors'][] = trans("vaahcms::messages.permission_denied");
        return $response;
    }
    
    $response['status'] = 'success';
    $response['messages'][] = 'Action is successful';
}


// this code will be in model
public static function getItem($id)
{
    $permission_response = Helper::checkPermission('hrc-can-read-customers');
    if($permission_response['status'] !== 'success') return $permission_response;
    
    $user = Auth::user();
    if(!$user) {
        $response['status'] = 'failed';
        $response['errors'][] = 'User not found';

        return $response;
    }

    $item = self::where('id', $id)
        ->withTrashed()
        ->first();

    $response['status'] = 'success';
    $response['data'] = $item;
    return $response;
}
```

### Prefer to use Eloquent over raw SQL queries

- Prefer to use Eloquent over using Query Builder and raw SQL queries. Prefer collections to arrays.
- Eloquent allows you to write readable and maintainable code. Also, Eloquent has great built-in tools like soft deletes, events, scopes etc.

**Bad Example**

```php 
SELECT *
FROM `articles`
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
FROM `users`
WHERE `articles`.`user_id` = `users`.`id`
AND EXISTS (SELECT *
FROM `profiles`
WHERE `profiles`.`user_id` = `users`.`id`)
AND `users`.`deleted_at` IS NULL)
AND `verified` = '1'
AND `active` = '1'
ORDER BY `created_at` DESC
```

**Good Example**

```php 
Article::has('user.profile')->verified()->latest()->get();
```
