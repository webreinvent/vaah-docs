# Vue & Nuxt Performance Improvement

## Introduction

This is a guide to improve Vue & Nuxt app performance.

## What Is A Page Loading Time

Page loading time is how long it takes for a website page to show up on your screen, from the moment 
you click on it to when it's fully loaded in your web browser. This matters for both mobile and desktop users.

A slow page speed can make your website seem glitchy, affect search engine rankings, and drive away
visitors. Losing mobile and desktop users happens quickly.

## How To Measure Page Speed

Discovering your page loading time is crucial. 

Utilize tools like: 

- [Google's Pagespeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/){:target="_blank"},
- [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools){:target="_blank"}
in chrome devtools.

By regularly monitoring and optimizing your page speed, you'll ensure a seamless 
experience for your users, keeping them engaged and satisfied.

### Preload critical assets to improve loading speed


When you visit a website, your browser asks the server for the main webpage, reads it, and then asks for 
other stuff the page needs. If you're a developer, you know what your page needs and what's really important.
You can be smart about it and ask for the important stuff first, making the webpage load faster. 
It's like telling the computer what to get first, so you see the webpage quicker!

So to achieve this, you can preload important resources by adding a `<link>` tag with `rel`=`'preload'` and
`as`=`{script/style}` to the head
of your HTML document.

**Example**
```html
<!--preload js file-->
<link rel="preload" as="script" href="critical.js">

<!--preload css file-->
<link rel="preload" as="style" href="critical.css">

```

## Optimize Images

### Use `srcset` Attribute In Image Tag

Using `srcset` isn't just about making your images look goodâ€”it's a powerful tool to supercharge your 
website's performance. By serving different images to different screens, you're not only optimizing 
visuals but also increasing page speed.

Smaller screens get smaller images, and larger, high-res screens get the quality they deserve. 
This smart approach reduces unnecessary data loading, making your website lightning-fast. Faster
load times not only delight visitors but also impress search engines.

**Example**
```html
<img src="default.jpg" srcset="small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px" alt="Description">

```

Here's a breakdown:

`src`: The default image that will be displayed if the browser doesn't support srcset. 

`srcset`: Specifies a list of images with their corresponding widths. The browser chooses 
the most appropriate image based on the user's device characteristics. 

`sizes`: Defines a set of media conditions and corresponding image sizes, helping the browser 
to select the appropriate image based on the viewport size.

## Speed Up with WebP Image Format

WebP is a modern image format offering superior compression, maintaining high quality while reducing file sizes.
WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable 
JPEG images at equivalent SSIM quality index. 

Consider using WebP for:

- **Improved Compression**: Faster loading times with smaller files. 

- **Quality Retention**: Crisp visuals without sacrificing performance.

- **Transparency Support**: Both lossy and lossless compression, plus transparency.

- **Browser Compatibility**: Widely supported across modern browsers.

### How to Use WebP

**Conversion Tools**: Use [webp converter](https://webpconverter.com/){:target="_blank"}, cwebp, online converters, or graphic design software.

**HTML Implementation**: Use <picture> or source elements to include WebP versions.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
</picture>

```
