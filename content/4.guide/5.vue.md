# Vue

## Introduction

This is a guide to maintain a consistent and industry stand code in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

## How to Debug

###### Important things you should  know when you are deal with Vuejs.

I make this documentation to save your debugging time and you can easily find the common error.

* If you are using `Axios for HTTP requests` then browser `console` will help you a lot to find the
  common error related to get request, post request, etc.

* If you are trying to debug the error in `Vuejs` then the Vue.js `Devtool` help you download the
  extension in your browser.

Some minor mistake

1. Define the API endpoint very carefully otherwise it takes a lot of time to find the error.
2. You can share your project on the internet using the below command.

```
for vue :-npx vite --host
for laravel:-php artisan serve --host=your ip address   
//Open cmd and type command  ipconfig to know your ip
```
