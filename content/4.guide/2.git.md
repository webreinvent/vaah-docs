# Git

### Introduction

We use git in all our project products, packages, modules and themes.

### Branching Strategy

We use `GitFlow` as a default strategy for git branch management.

### What is GitFlow?

Gitflow is a branching model, a particularly useful framework for streamlining collaboration and scaling teams.

It contains following branches:

|Branch| Purpose |
|--|--|
|Master or Main| This contains your production code. |
|Develop| This is the most active branch in which all branches are merged. This contains the most updated code. |
|Feature| These are the branches created by developers to develop features. These branches are merged by `Merge Request` or `Pull Request` to `develop` branch. |
|Release| These are the branches created from the `develop` branch to eventually merge in `master` & `develop`. |
|Hotfix| These are the branches created from the `master` branch to eventually merge in `master` & `develop`. |

### Commits

Please follow following logic for your commit messages:

```shell
<type>: <description>


[optional body]

[optional footer]

```

Where `type` can have following values:

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

## Squash Commits

### What is Squash Commits?

To `squash` in Git means to combine multiple commits into one.

When you squash commits, you're essentially saying, "I want to take several of these individual commits and combine them into one commit."
This can make the commit history cleaner and easier to follow because it reduces the number of commits in your branch's history.

NOTE   
Squash commits primarily work within a single branch, and they are not used 
to combine commits from multiple branches.

#### Why we use Squash Commits?

### Efficient Sharing

Imagine you're working on a feature or a change in a Git repository, and you make multiple commits as 
you progress. Each commit represents a step in your work, like saving your progress in a video game. 
If you share a link to each of these commits with a reviewer, it can be time-consuming for them to open
and review each individual commit.

### Simplifying Review

Squash commits help simplify the review process. Instead of sending a long list of individual commit 
links, you can group them together into a single, coherent commit. It's like condensing all your progress
into one well-documented step.


### Time-Saving

Here is the squash commit, it takes the default name from one of the commits in the list you can change the default  name as well. With this
feature, you can simply click on this squash commit, which combines multiple commits into
one for a cleaner history. Then, you can send the resulting link to the reviewer, making it
easier for them to review the changes as a single coherent unit.


By using squash commits, you save time for both yourself and the reviewer. You present your work as a
single, comprehensive change, making it easier for the reviewer to understand and provide feedback. 
This efficiency benefits everyone involved in the collaboration process.

## Implement of Squash Commit

### 1. Open Your Repository:

Launch GitKraken and open the Git repository where you want to squash commits.

### 2. Open the Commit Graph:
In the GitKraken interface, you'll see a visual representation of your commit history called 
the "Commit Graph" on the right side of the window. This graph displays all the commits in your branch.

<img src="/images/git-squash-1.png">

In the image, I've highlighted a series of commits using a red rectangle. These highlighted commits are the ones that 
I'll combine into a squash commit. This process condenses multiple individual commits into a single, 
unified commit, making it easier to manage and understand the project's commit history.

### 3. Select Commits to Squash:
To begin the squashing process, first identify the commits you want to squash together in the Commit 
Graph. You can do this by clicking and dragging to select multiple commits, 
or you can use the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key while clicking to select multiple commits individually.

### 4. Right-Click and Choose "Squash":
After selecting the desired commits, right-click on one of them. From the context menu that appears,
choose "Squash Commits."

### 5. Edit the Commit Message (Optional):

GitKraken will open a dialog where you can edit the commit message for the new squashed commit. 
By default, it will include the commit messages of the selected commits. 
You can modify this message as needed.



### 6. Push Changes

If you have already pushed these commits to a remote repository, GitKraken may prompt you to push the
changes to the remote branch.

## Upstream Branch  On Git

### What is Upstream Branch ?


An `upstream branch` in Git refers to a branch in your local repository that is associated with and
tracks a branch in a remote repository. This remote branch is typically the one from which you
originally cloned the repository.


## Use  of Upstream Branch

An upstream branch in Git acts as a bridge connecting your local repository branch to the
branch in the remote repository stored on a remote server.
It simplifies sharing your changes with others by allowing you to push your code from your local
repository branch to the remote repository branch.

### 1. Collaboration and Contribution
Upstream branches are especially helpful when collaborating with others on a Git project. If you're
working on a team or contributing to an open-source project, the upstream branch allows you to keep
your local branch synchronized with the main project's branch. You can easily pull the
latest changes made by others and, in turn, push your own contributions back to the main project.

### 2. Keeping Local Repositories Updated
Upstream branches ensure that your local repositories are up to date with the latest changes from
the remote repository. This is essential for avoiding conflicts and working with the most recent code.
You can regularly fetch or pull changes from the upstream branch to stay current.

### 3. Tracking Progress
Upstream branches help you track the progress of a project or repository. By following the changes
in the upstream branch, you can see what others are working on, including new features,
bug fixes, or improvements. This provides valuable insight into the project's development.

## Implementing Upstream on GitKraken

In GitKraken, when you push your code from your local repository branch to the remote repository that you've cloned,
it essentially goes to the upstream branch. This is the default behavior in GitKraken, where the
repository you clone on your local system and the code you push are associated
with the upstream branch.
