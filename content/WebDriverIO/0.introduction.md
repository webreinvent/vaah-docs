# Introduction
In this section we will learn about the WebdriverIO framework. We will learn what is WebdriverIO, Why it is important, and will learn few concept about WebdriverIO architecture.

## What is WebdriverIO
WebdriverIO is an open-source testing automation framework written in JavaScript and running on NodeJS. It is particularly useful for testing web applications and native mobile applications for iOS-enabled devices. Its support for both Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD) makes it a highly preferred choice for automation testers.

## Why WebdriverIO

WebdriverIO is an automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite.

<u>You can use WebdriverIO to automate:</u>

- Modern web applications written in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or other frontend frameworks
- Hybrid or native mobile applications running in an emulator/simulator or on a real device
- Native desktop applications (e.g. written with Electron.js)
- Unit or component testing of web components in the browser

<u>It is designed to be:</u>

- **Extendable** - Adding helper functions, or more complicated sets and combinations of existing commands is simple and really useful
- **Compatible** - WebdriverIO can be run on the WebDriver Protocol for true cross-browser testing as well as [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) for Chromium based automation using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).
- **Feature Rich** - The huge variety of built-in and community plugins allows you to easily integrate and extend your setup to fulfill your requirements.

To know more about why webdriverIO is better than other automation testing framework, refer to the video given below:

## WebdriverIO Architecture
WebdriverIO is built over NodeJS, which is an implementation of the [JSON Wire Protocol](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/jsonwp/). Packaged into npm, it conducts communication using NodeJS, which is open-source and widely used for application development. It uses [RESTful architecture](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/jsonwp/) to conduct automation testing.

The user writes the test script in JavaScript using the WebdriverIO library, where the Service request is sent via NodeJS as an HTTP command. It uses JSON Wire protocol, and the services' module forwards the request to the browser.
