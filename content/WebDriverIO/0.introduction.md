#### Why WebdriverIO

WebdriverIO is an automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite.

You can use WebdriverIO to automate:

- modern web applications written in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or other frontend frameworks
- hybrid or native mobile applications running in an emulator/simulator or on a real device
- native desktop applications (e.g. written with Electron.js)
- unit or component testing of web components in the browser

It is designed to be:

- **Extendable** - Adding helper functions, or more complicated sets and combinations of existing commands is simple and really useful
- **Compatible** - WebdriverIO can be run on the WebDriver Protocol for true cross-browser testing as well as [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) for Chromium based automation using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).
- **Feature Rich** - The huge variety of built-in and community plugins allows you to easily integrate and extend your setup to fulfill your requirements.
