## Introduction

The OHO Project module is designed to efficiently organize and manage software testing through key components: Test Suites, Test Cases, Projects, Test Runs, and Test Reports. Each component plays a specific role in the overall workflow to ensure thorough testing and effective tracking.

## Overall Workflow

1. **Project Creation**: Start by creating a project and associating it with relevant test suites.
2. **Test Suite Management**: Organize test cases within test suites, creating, editing, and deleting as needed.
3. **Test Case Creation**: Develop detailed test cases for each feature, ensuring thorough testing.
4. **Test Run Execution**: Create test runs, assign them to testers, and execute the test cases.
5. **Test Case Management**: Manage test cases within test runs, marking them as passed, failed, skipped, or retest.
6. **Test Report Generation**: Generate test reports to summarize testing results and share with stakeholders.

This structured approach allows for efficient management and execution of tests, ensuring thorough tracking and reporting of software quality. By following these steps, users can easily organize and track their testing processes from creation to execution and reporting.
