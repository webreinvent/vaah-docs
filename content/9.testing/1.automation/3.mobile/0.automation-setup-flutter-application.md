**Note:**
- If you already have flutter SDK installed, skip the steps mentioned below. Run the command given below in terminal to verify the version of flutter installed on your system
    ```shell
    flutter --version
    ```
- The below mentioned steps are only for **MacOS** users. For windows user, follow the steps given in this [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile?tab=download#install-the-flutter-sdk).
::
1. Download flutter SDK zip file based on your system configuration using this [link](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-android?tab=download#install-the-flutter-sdk). Choose according to your system's processor.
2. Once the file is downloaded, unzip the file where you want to install the flutter sdk.
3. Open the terminal and run the command mentioned below:
    ```shell
    open ~/.zshrc
    ```
4. In a file that opens, add the below command at the top of the file.
    ```shell
    export PATH=$HOME/flutter/bin:$PATH
    ```
5. Save the file and run command: `source ~/.zshrc` command.
6. Now, check the flutter version using the command: `flutter --version`.
7. For further details, run this command to verify if the installation is correct:
    ```shell
    flutter doctor -v
    ```
8. Now, open VSCode IDE and select `Extensions` tab from the left menu.
9. Search 'flutter' and install the first flutter extenstion.
With this, the installation of flutter SDK is complete.

### Step 2: Create a Sample flutter App
To create a sample flutter application for testing. Follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Open the terminal window in the directory you want to create your project.
2. Enter the following command to create a sample project:
    ```shell
    flutter create YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
    ```
    ::alert{type="warning" class="p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-yellow-800 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-300 dark:border-yellow-800" role="alert"}
    If you get an error: `"YOUR_PROJECT_NAME" is not a valid Dart package name.`. Try using a different project in the command above.
    ::
3. Once the project is created, open it on VSCode IDE.
4. **For Android:** Start your android emulator through Android Studio.
5. **For iOS:** Open the iOS simulator by clicking on the simulator icon form the Dock.
6. Open the terminal on VSCode and run the command given below to start debugging your application.
    ```shell
    flutter run
    ```
7. When the command asks to select a device, choose the emulator/simulator which is running. If not, then continue.
8. The application should be running in the emulator device after a while.

::alert{type="warning" class="p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-yellow-800 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-300 dark:border-yellow-800" role="alert"}
If you have any issues regarding the emulator setup and running. Reach out to our **system administration** department for assistance.

## Configure Flutter Application
After setting up flutter and creating a sample application. We need to configure few files to allow webdriverio-appium to automate the app.

Follow the steps mentioned below to configure the flutter application:

### Step 1: Update `pubspec.yaml` file
Navigate to the sample app project in VSCode and open file `pubspec.yaml`.

- If the app is still running, close the app. Click on the terminal in which the app is running and press `Ctrl+C` on Keyboard.

- Add the statements given below in the in the file.
    ```yaml
    test: ^1.24.1
    flutter_test:
        sdk: flutter
    flutter_driver:
        sdk: flutter
    ```
  <img src="/images/webdriverio/flutter_conf_one.png">

- After adding the above statements, run `flutter pub get` command in the terminal to update the changes.

### Step 2: Update `main.dart` file
Open `main.dart` file and add the following statements.
- Add the statement given below at the top of the file.
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_driver/driver_extension.dart';
    ```
- Also add the below statement inside main() method.
    ```dart
    enableFlutterDriverExtension();Open 
    ```
- Refer to the screenshot given below:
  <img src="/images/webdriverio/flutter_conf_two.png">

### Step 3: Add `keys` for automation testing
Open `main.dart` file and do the following changes:
- Add the below statement in the file.
    ```dart
    key: const Key('counter'),
    ```
- Similarly add the code given below in the location.
    ```dart
    key: const Key('plus_btn'),
    ```
    Refer to the screenshot given below:
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/flutter_config_key.png">

### Step 3: Run the application
To get the **apk**/**ios-app**  needed, open your Android Studio, and Launch the emulator or open your iOS simulator. Then run command `flutter run` in your flutter project terminal. 

You can close the emulator/simulator for now.

**With this, the configuration for the flutter application is now complete.**

## Setup WebdriverIO project
In this we are going to setup a WebdriverIO project for automating the mobile application we just created in the prior steps.

To setup the project, follow the steps mentioned in the [documentation](../1.web/0.setup-new-project.md#setup-webdriverio-project) till **Step 9** of **Setup WebdriverIO project** section. Now follow the steps given below:
1. For "Which type of environment would you like?". Select **Mobile**.
2. For "Which mobile environment you'ld like to automate?". Select **Android** for now. We will setup iOS automation as well.
3. For "Which framework do you want to use?". Select **Mocha**.
4. For "Do you want to use a compiler?". Select **No**.
5. For "Do you want WebdriverIO to autogenerate some test files?". Type **n** and press Enter.
6. Choose **spec reporter**  for test case reporting.
7. For "Do you want to add plugins to your test setup?". Select **wait-for**. Press **Space** and then **Enter**.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/plugin.png">
8. For "Would you like to include Visual Testing to your setup?". Press **Enter**.
9. For "Do you want to add a service to your test setup?". Select **Appium**.
10. When "Do you want me install `npm install` is prompted. Press **Enter**.
11. Wait for the command `npm install` to complete.
12. After the setup is complete, it will ask you to "Continue with Appium setup using appium-installer". Press **Enter**.
13. After a while it will ask you to "Select an option (Use arrow keys)". Select option **Install Appium Server**. Then select **Select latest Server version:**.
14. Wait till the appium server is installed.
15. After the installation is complete, a success message will be visible. Refer to the screenshot below:
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/flutter_setup_two.png">
16. Similarly, select **Run Appium Doctor**. Then select **Android**
17. At last select **Exit**. (Press **Space** and then **Enter**.)

## Configuration
Now, before running the test scripts we need to install several packages, configure the `wdio.conf.js` file. We also need to create **env** file so that the capabilities for different platforms can be added.

### Install Dependencies
To install the required dependencies and configure `package.json` file, follow the steps given below:

1. Run following commands in the terminal of the Code Editor (Make sure the path is set to your project directory).
    - First we will install `appium` in our project.
        ```shell
        npm i appium --save-dev
        ```
    - After this, `appium-flutter-driver` is installed which performs actions on mobile app. To know more, refer [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appium-flutter-driver?activeTab=readme) 
        ```shell
        npm i appium-flutter-driver --save-dev
        ```
    - Similarly, we will install `appium-flutter-finder`. This will be used to locate elements in flutter app. To know more, refer [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appium-flutter-finder?activeTab=explore)
        ```shell
        npm i appium-flutter-finder --save-dev
        ```
    - Next, we will install `assert` module to make assertions in out test script.
        ```shell
        npm i assert --save-dev
        ```
    - Similarly, we will install `chai` to use various expect methods in it.
        ```shell
        npm i chai --save-dev
        ```
    - Finally, run this command:
        ```shell 
        npm i chalk cli-color cross-env ts-node typescript --save-dev
        ```
2. In `package.json` file, replace the code in script with the below code:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "wdio": "cross-env wdio run ./wdio.conf.js",
        "wdio debug": "cross-env NODE_WDIO_DEBUG=true wdio run ./wdio.conf.js",
        "wdio ios": "cross-env NODE_WDIO_OS=ios wdio run ./wdio.conf.js",
        "wdio android": "cross-env NODE_WDIO_OS=android wdio run ./wdio.conf.js"
    }
    ```
3. Also add `"type":"module"` inside package.json file. Refer to the code below:
    ```json
    ...
    "type": "module",
    "devDependencies": {
        ...
    }
    ```
### Configure ENV file 
1. Create a new file in the root folder of the project, where the file `wdio.conf.js` file is located.
2. Name the file `wdio.env.js`.
3. Add the code given below inside the file:
    ```js
    class Env {

        constructor() {

            this.params = {
                debug: false,
                env: null,
                log_level: 'error',
                small_pause: 5000,
                medium_pause: 10000,
                long_pause: 25000,
                app_id: 'com.toolstation.mobile_app.dev',
                version: null,
                capabilities: [{
                        platformName: 'Android',
                        'appium:deviceName': 'P7A34',
                        'appium:platformVersion': '14',
                        'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
                        'appium:app': 'path of the apk file',
                        'appium:fullReset': true,
                        'appium:noReset': false,
                        'appium:autoGrantPermissions': true,
                }]
            };
        } 
        //-------------------------------------------------
        setId(){
            const env = process.argv[4];

            if(env == 'ios')
                this.params.app_id = 'com.toolstation.mobile-app.dev'
            else
                this.params.app_id = 'com.toolstation.mobile_app.dev'
        }

        setCapabilities()
        {
            const env = process.argv[4];

            switch(env)
            {
                case 'android':
                    this.params.capabilities = [{
                        platformName: 'Android',
                        'appium:deviceName': 'P7A34',
                        'appium:platformVersion': '14',
                        'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
                        'appium:app': 'path of apk file',
                        'appium:fullReset': true,
                        'appium:noReset': false,
                        'appium:autoGrantPermissions': true,
                    }]
                    break;
                case 'ios':
                    this.params.capabilities = [{
                        platformName: 'iOS',
                        'appium:deviceName': 'iPhone 15 Pro',
                        'appium:platformVersion': '17.2',
                        'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
                        'appium:app':'path of the iOS runner file',
                        'appium:noReset': false,
                        'appium:autoLaunch': true,
                        'appium:autoAcceptAlerts': true
                    }]
                    break;
            }
        }
        //-------------------------------------------------
        getParams () {
            this.setId();
            this.setCapabilities();
            console.log('params-->', this.params);
            return this.params;
        }
    }
    export default Env;
    ```
    ::alert{type="warning" class="p-3 mb-5 text-sm text-blue-800 border border-blue-300 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:border-blue-800" role="alert"}
    **Note**:
    In the capabilities, specify the value of different objects as per the description given below:
    - **appium:deviceName**: Add the name of your emulator/simulator.
    - **appium:platformVersion'**: Add the verion of the emulation/simulator software.
    - **appium:app**: Add the path of the apk/app file that you want to test.
    ::
    ::alert{type="warning" class="p-3 mb-5 text-sm text-blue-800 border border-blue-300 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:border-blue-800" role="alert"}
    **How to find the path of the apk/app file**
    
    **For Android:**
    1. Open the flutter app project in Code Editor (VSCode)
    2. Navigate to this `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk` directory in your flutter project.
    3. Locate the .apk file in the directory. Ignore the file with .sha extension.
    4. Right click on the apk file and select 'Copy Path' option.
    5. Paste the path of your apk file in the env file of your automation project.
    
    **For iOS:**
    1. Open the flutter app project in Code Editor (VSCode)
    2. Navigate to this `build/ios/iphonesimulator/Runner.app` directory in your flutter project.
    3. Locate the .app file in the directory.
    4. Right click on the apk file and select 'Copy Path' option.
    5. Paste the path of your apk file in the env file of your automation project.
    ::
    

### Configure `wdio.conf.js` file
After this, we need to configure the `wdio.conf.js` file. Open the file and follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Add the following code at the top of the file in order to import `wdio.env.js` file created in step 3 of Configure ENV File section.
    ```js
    import env from "./wdio.env.js";
    const envObj = new env();
    const params = envObj.getParams();
    ```
2. Replace `exports.config` to `export const config`. Refer to the code snippet below:
    ```js
    export const config = {
        ...
    }
    ```
3. Enter this code: `env: params,` inside exports.config. Refer to the code below:
    ```js
    export const config = {
        env: params,
        //
        // ====================
        // Runner Configuration
        // ====================
        ...
    }
    ```
4. For the `capabilities` replace the code with `capabilities: params.capabilities,`. Refer to the code below:
    ```js
    export const config = {
        ...
        capabilities: params.capabilities,
        ...
    }
    ```
Now, the configuration is completed. But we still need to do some changes with the test files before we can start running our script.

### Configure test files.
Now, we will create and configure the test files before working on automation script. 

1. Create a directory named: `tests` in the project root directory.
2. Create another directory named: `spec` inside `tests` directory created earlear.
3. Create a file named: `test.e2e.js` inside `spec` directory.
4. Configure `test.e2e.js` file
    Open the `test.e2e.js` file. Add the code snippet given below in the file:
    ```js
    import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
    import {expect} from 'chai'
    describe('Flutter Automation Testing', () => {
        it('Verify if the counter button is funtional or not', async () => {
            const plus_btn = find.byValueKey('plus_btn');
            const counter = find.byValueKey('counter');
            await driver.elementClick(plus_btn);
            await driver.elementClick(plus_btn);
            expect(await driver.getElementText(counter)).to.be.equal('2');
        })
    })
    ```

### Executing the test script
Before running the test script, add the path of the test script in the `wdio.conf.js`. Open the file and locate **specs** keyword. Add the below code for the **specs**.
```js
specs: [
    './tests/spec/test.e2e.js'
],
```
#### Running Tests on Android Emulator
Before running the script, update the following data as suggested:
1. Open `wdio.env.js` file and update the following in capabilities from both **params** and **setcapabilities**:
    - **appium:deviceName**: Add the name of your emulator.
    - **appium:platformVersion'**: Add the android version running on the emulator.
    - **appium:app**: Add the path of the apk file that you want to test.
    ::alert{type="warning" class="p-3 mb-5 text-sm text-blue-800 border border-blue-300 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:border-blue-800" role="alert"}
    **Note**:
    In the setcapabilities() method, update the points mentioned above only in the **android** switch case.
    ::

2. Save, run the command given below:
