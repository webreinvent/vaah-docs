## Introduction
This documentation is all about getting started with the Flutter App automation using WebdriverIO. Here you will learn about all the concepts required to automate a flutter app using WebdriverIO and appium.

## Locate Elements in Flutter App
To locate the elements in the flutter app, follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Open the flutter application project in your IDE (VS Code preferred).
2. Start the emulator.
3. Select **Run & Debug** option from the left menu.
4. Now, click on the play button. If the play button is not visible follow thw steps below otherwise go to **step 8**.
5. Click on **Run & Debug**.
6. Select **Dart & Flutter..** option.
7. Then select **Flutter [your_application_name]**.
8. Now, click on the play button.
9. Once the application is running on the emulator, click on the devtools option from the toolbar at the top. Refer to the image below:

10. A **Widget Inspector** window should have opened. Select the **widget mode** option. Refer to the image below:
    <img src="/images/testing/widget_mode.png">
11. Open the emulator and click on the element you want to locate.
12. The code snippet relative to the element should be visible on the code editor.
13. Repeat the same steps to locate all the elements.

## Selectors
To locate a flutter element using WebdriverIO, we a need a seperate package called `appium-flutter-finder`. This package contains several functions which help us to locate a flutter element within the automation script.

There are 4 locators which are available in package `appium-flutter-finder`. Lets look at each of them one by one

### 1. byValueKey
This is used to locate an element using the key widget added in the element. This is same as `id` we use for web elements.

**Flutter Code:**
```dart
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
    key: const Key('plus_btn'),
    onPressed: _incrementCounter,
    tooltip: 'Increment',
    child: const Icon(Icons.add),
),
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const btn = find.byValueKey('plus_btn');
```

### 2. byText
This is used to locate an element using the text in the element.

**Flutter Code:**
```dart
const Text(
    'This is button',
),
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const text = find.byText('This is button');
```

### 3. byType
This locator strategy is used to locate an element using the type of the element in flutter code.

**Flutter Code:**
```dart
child: TextField(
    obscureText: true,
        decoration: InputDecoration(
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            labelText: 'Password',
),
),
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const textfield = find.byType('TextField');
```

### 4. byTooltip
This locator strategy is used to locate an element using the tooltip text added on the input field.
**Flutter Code:**
```dart
Tooltip(message: "Hello World", child: new Text("foo"));
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const textfield = find.byTooltip('Hello World')
```
::alert{type="warning" class="p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-blue-800 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:border-yellow-800" role="alert"}
**Note:** It is advised to use the 'byValueKey' locator for locating elements as it is more reliable that others.
