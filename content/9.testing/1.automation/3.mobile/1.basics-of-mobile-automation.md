## Introduction
This documentation is all about getting started with the Flutter app automation using WebdriverIO. Here you will learn about all the concepts required to automate a flutter app using WebdriverIO and appium.

## Locate Elements in Flutter App
To locate the elements in the flutter app, follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Open the flutter application project in your IDE (VS Code preferred).
2. Start the emulator.
3. Select **Run & Debug** option from the left menu.
4. Now, click on the play button. If the play button is not visible, follow the steps below; otherwise, go to **step 8**.
5. Click on **Run & Debug**.
6. Select **Dart & Flutter..** option.
7. Then select **Flutter [your_application_name]**.
8. Now, click on the play button.
9. Once the application is running on the emulator, click on the devtools option from the toolbar at the top. Refer to the image below: 
    <img src="/images/testing/flutter_toolbar.png">
10. A **Widget Inspector** window should have opened. Select the **widget mode** option. Refer to the image below:
    <img src="/images/testing/widget_mode.png">
11. Open the emulator and click on the element you want to locate.
12. The code snippet relative to the element should be visible in the code editor.
13. Repeat the same steps to locate all the elements.

## Appium Configuration for App.
Before working with the automation script for the Flutter app, we need to understand the different capabilities that Appium offers for mobile testing.

For mobile, we need different capabilities that we need to add to the `wdio.conf.js` file. Refer to the code snippet given below:
```js
capabilities: [{
        platformName: 'Android',
        'appium:deviceName': 'P7A34',
        'appium:platformVersion': '14',
        'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
        'appium:app': 'Complete path of your apk/runner app file',
        'appium:autoGrantPermissions': true,
}]
```
Let's look at each of these capabilities one by one:
1. **platformName**: It is used to specify the name of the platform on which you are trying to run your tests. e.g. 'Android' and 'iOS'
2. **appium:deviceName**: It is used to specify the name of the device on which you are trying to execute your tests. This should be the exact name of the emulator/simulator device.
3. **appium:platformVersion**: This specifies the version of the OS running on you emulator/simulator.
4. **appium:automationName**: This specifies the name of the automation you are using to automate the app. If you are using `Flutter` automationName, you must add `appium-flutter-driver` to your project's dependencies. Eg. 'UIAutomator2', 'XCUITest'.
5. **appium:app**: This is used to specify the path of the apk/app runner file that you are testing.

Apart from the capabilities mentioned above, there are a few important ones available. Let's go through them in brief:

#### appium:autoGrantPermissions
This capability is used to handle permisions within the app. If this is set to `true` all the permissions within the app are automatically granted. Accepted values: `true` or `false`
```js
'appium:autoGrantPermissions': true
```

#### appium:noReset
Setting 'appium:noReset' to false ensures that the application state is not reset between sessions, allowing for continuous testing without reinstalling or clearing app data. Accepted values: `true` or `false`
```js
'appium:noReset': false,
```

#### appium:fullReset
By setting 'appium:fullReset' to false, you can prevent the application from being completely uninstalled and reinstalled between test sessions, preserving data and configurations for efficient and targeted testing. Accepted values: `true` or `false`
```js
'appium:fullReset': false,
```

#### appium:appWaitDuration
Setting 'appium:appWaitDuration' defines the duration in milliseconds for which Appium will wait for the app to be ready before timing out, ensuring smoother test execution by allowing sufficient time for the application to load completely. Accepted values: timeout in milliseconds.
```js
'appium:appWaitDuration': 20000,
```

#### appium:orientation
Setting 'appium:orientation' specifies the initial orientation (landscape or portrait) of the device or emulator before starting the test session, ensuring consistent testing conditions for applications that rely on specific screen orientations. Accepted values: `landscape` or `portrait`
```js
'appium:orientation': 'landscape'
```

There are many more capabilities under Appium that are available for mobile. Refer to this [documentation](https://appium.github.io/appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps/) to learn more.

## Selectors
To locate a Flutter element using WebdriverIO, we need a separate package called `appium-flutter-finder`. This package contains several functions that help us locate a Flutter element within the automation script.

There are 4 locators that are available in package `appium-flutter-finder`. Let's look at each of them one by one.

### 1. byValueKey
This is used to locate an element using the key widget added to the element. This is the same as the `id` we use for web elements.

**Flutter Code:**
```dart
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
    key: const Key('plus_btn'),
    onPressed: _incrementCounter,
    tooltip: 'Increment',
    child: const Icon(Icons.add),
),
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const btn = find.byValueKey('plus_btn');
```

### 2. byText
This is used to locate an element using the text in the element.

**Flutter Code:**
```dart
const Text(
    'This is button',
),
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const text = find.byText('This is button');
```

### 3. byType
This locator strategy is used to locate an element using the type of the element in Flutter code.

**Flutter Code:**
```dart
child: TextField(
    obscureText: true,
        decoration: InputDecoration(
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            labelText: 'Password',
),
),
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const textfield = find.byType('TextField');
```

### 4. byTooltip
This locator strategy is used to locate an element using the tooltip text added to the input field.
**Flutter Code:**
```dart
Tooltip(message: "Hello World", child: new Text("foo"));
```
**WebdriverIO Code:**
```js
import find from 'appium-flutter-finder'
const textfield = find.byTooltip('Hello World')
```
::alert{type="warning" class="p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-blue-800 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:border-yellow-800" role="alert"}
**Note:** It is advised to use the 'byValueKey' locator for locating elements as it is more reliable than others.

## Methods
In this section, we go through different methods available in WebdriverIO that help us automate the Flutter app. For this, we need a separate package called `appium-flutter-driver`. This package includes all the functions needed to automate a Flutter app. Let's look at them one by one.

### elementClick
This method is used to click/tap on an element within the app.
```js
const button = find.byValueKey('key_value');
await driver.elementClick(button);
```

### elementSendKeys
This method is used to input values into an element.
```js
const username = find.byValueKey('username');
await driver.elementSendKeys(username, 'test@gmail.com');
```

### pause
This method is used to add waits/pauses during the test execution.
```js
await driver.pause(3000) //wait duration in milliseconds
```

### elementClear
This method is used to clear the value inside an element.
```js
const username = find.byValueKey('username');
await driver.elementSendKeys(username, 'test@gmail.com');
await driver.elementClear(username);
```

### getElementText
This method is used to fetch the text inside an element.
```js
const heading = find.byValueKey('heading');
const text = await driver.getElementText(heading);
```

### terminateApp
This method is used to terminate the app that is running during the test. It takes `app_id` as a parameter.
```js
await driver.terminateApp('app_id');
```

### activateApp
This method is used to activate the app using the specific app ID. The app should be installed on the device before performing this.
```js
await driver.activateApp('app_id');
```

To explore more about the methods available in `appium-flutter-driver`, refer to this [documentation](https://github.com/appium/appium-flutter-driver?tab=readme-ov-file#commands) by github.com

## Commands
Apart from the methods, there are several commands available for the Flutter app that we can use to add waits, scrolls, etc. using the execute() method. 

### scroll
Used to scroll to a specific location within the app.
```js
await driver.execute('flutter:scroll', find.byType('ListView'), {dx: 50, dy: -100, durationMilliseconds: 200, frequency: 30})
```

### scrollIntoView
Used to scroll into a view of a specific element within the app.
```js
await driver.execute('flutter:scrollIntoView', find.byType('TextField'), {alignment: 0.1})
await driver.execute('flutter:scrollIntoView', find.byType('TextField'), {alignment: 0.1, timeout: 30000})
```

### waitFor
Used to wait for a specific element within a timeout period.
```js
await driver.execute('flutter:waitFor', buttonFinder, 100)
```

### waitForAbsent
Used to wait for an element to disappear from the viewport.
```js
await driver.execute('flutter:waitForAbsent', buttonFinder)
```

To know more about the commands available with the execute method, refer to this [documentation](https://github.com/appium/appium-flutter-driver?tab=readme-ov-file#commands) by github.com.

## Assertions
There is no default assertion available in WebdriverIO for mobile applications. To add assertions in our script, we use the `chai` assertion module.

First, we need to install the package using the following command:
```shell
npm i chai --save-dev
```
After the package is installed, we can import and use the expect method inside the `chai` module.

### Assert using Text
To assert your tests with matching text, use the command given below:
```js
import { expect } from 'chai'

const element = await find.byValueKey('haeding');
const text = await driver.getElementText(element);
expect(text).to.equal('expected_value'); 	//matches the exact expected value with the text.
expect(text).to.include('expected_value');  //matches a part of expected value with the text
```

### Assert if an element is displayed or not.
To assert if an element is displayed on the app or not, we have to use error handling with the flutter:waitFor command.

We have to create a custom function with command the flutter:waitFor and error handling. Refer to the code below:

```js
import { expect } from 'chai' 

async isDisplayed(element, milliSeconds = 1000) {
    try {
        await driver.execute('flutter:waitFor', element, milliSeconds);
        return true;
    } catch (error) {
        return false;
    }
}


const element = await find.byValueKey('heading');
expect(await this.isDisplayed(element)).to.be.true;
```

There are many more methods available with chai/expect. Refer to this [documentation by chaijs.com](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/).

## How to Execute Script on Flutter Application
To run the sample automation script of a Flutter app, there are several steps we need to follow to enable automation testing for Flutter application. Refer to the steps given below:

1. Open the Flutter application. (If not present, create a sample app using this [documentation](https://docs.vaah.dev/testing/automation/mobile/flutter-automation-setup))
2. Do the configurations added in this [documentation](https://docs.vaah.dev/testing/automation/mobile/flutter-automation-setup#configure-flutter-application) to enable automation testing for the app.
::alert{type="warning" class="flex items-center p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-yellow-800 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-300 dark:border-yellow-800" role="alert"}
These configuration are important for automation testing. The automation script will not work if the configurations are not done properly. 
::
3. Locate elements which you want to automate using the [Locate Elements in Flutter App](./1.basics-of-mobile-automation.md#locate-elements-in-flutter-app) section of this documentation.
4. Add keys to those elements. Refer to this [documentation](https://docs.vaah.dev/testing/automation/mobile/flutter-automation-setup#step-3-add-keys-for-automation-testing).
5. After making all the changes within the app code, run the app again.
6. Setup a automation project for testing. Refer to this [documentation](https://docs.vaah.dev/testing/automation/mobile/flutter-automation-setup#setup-webdriverio-project).
7. Write automation script for the app.
8. Run the automation script using the commands mentioned in this [documentation](https://docs.vaah.dev/testing/automation/mobile/flutter-automation-setup#executing-the-test-script).
9. For a sample script, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.vaah.dev/testing/automation/mobile/flutter-automation-setup#configure-test-files).
