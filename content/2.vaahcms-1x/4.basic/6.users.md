#####  User Listing

Get a list of all your users, and their data in one place. The Users table contains all of your user data and the `VaahCms` puts all user management functions right at your fingertips. You have the ability to `add`, `edit`, and `delete` users. You can also `search`, `sort`, and `filter` your user data and modify user information and `roles`, all in the same place.

##### Password Reset

Your users need the ability to change their password without contacting you, the `Administrator`. Donâ€™t waste time manually assisting users that lose or forget their password. If you need to handle a password change yourself, you can do it from Backend.
