title: The Concept
---


Every application requires some fundamental features like:

1. `Structure`: A consistent file, folder and code pattern.
2. `Extensibility & Flexibility`: Ability to extent and modify features and code without creating conflicts.
3. `Code Isolation`: Clear & transparent code isolation yet isolated code can talk to each other.
4. `Common Functionality`: Builtin most fundamental features like logic, access control etc.

All such features has been taken care during the inception of the VaahCMS.
