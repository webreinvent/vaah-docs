## Laravel Performance: Reduce Memory Usage & Optimize Queries

Improving performance in Laravel goes beyond just faster queries â€” it also includes reducing memory usage. One major area of optimization is how we load and process data.

Using **Eloquent collections** instead of traditional `foreach` loops allows Laravel to leverage more efficient internal methods, resulting in lower memory consumption and cleaner code. Additionally, properly **eager-loading relationships** with the `with()` method helps prevent the **N+1 query problem**, which can severely degrade performance.

This video highlights the best practices for:

- Reducing memory usage in Laravel apps
- Using collections over `foreach` loops
- Eager loading relationships efficiently
- Writing cleaner, more performant Eloquent queries
