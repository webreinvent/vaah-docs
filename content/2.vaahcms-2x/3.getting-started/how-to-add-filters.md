title: How To Add Filters in Crud
---


## Purpose

Adding filters to the CRUD operations means giving users the ability to specify criteria for the records they want to view or
interact with. Instead of displaying all records at once, filters allow users to narrow down the results based on certain
parameters such as date, category, or specific attributes.

For example, imagine you have a list of customer records in a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.
Without filters, users would need to manually scroll through the entire list to find a particular customer. 
However, with filters, users can quickly refine the list to only show customers who, for instance, made a purchase
in the last month, are located in a specific region, or belong to a particular industry.

This functionality greatly enhances usability by saving users time and effort. They no longer have to sift through large 
amounts of data to find what they're looking for. Instead, they can apply filters to quickly narrow down the results and 
locate the specific records they need.
