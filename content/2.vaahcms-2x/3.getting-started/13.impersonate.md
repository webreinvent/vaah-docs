## Purpose


In Vaah CMS, the `Impersonation` feature within the User CRUD , this  functionality enables users to 
temporarily log in as a different user within their network. This capability is particularly useful for administrators or users
with full impersonation permissions. With full impersonation rights, individuals can assume the identity of any other user 
within their network and carry out actions as if they were that user, irrespective of their own permission level. 
This grants extensive flexibility and control, allowing administrators to troubleshoot, test functionalities, or 
assist users more effectively within the CMS ecosystem.

## Steps to Impersonate Other users

After successfully installing Vaah CMS, when you set it up locally on your system, it will automatically assign you the role
of super-administrator. A super-administrator has all the permissions defined in Vaah CMS.

## 1. Open Users Crud

To access the Users CRUD, click on `Users` as shown in the image. Once you click on the `Users & Access` menu,
a submenu will appear. Click on "Users" from this submenu. This will display the Users CRUD, where you can see the list of
all users.

## 2. Go to Actions in the Crud List 

In the action column, you will see four buttons: `Update`, `View`, `Trash`, and `Impersonate`. To impersonate a user,
simply click on the `Impersonate` button for the user's record you wish to impersonate.

## 3.Logged in as Another User 

Once you click on the `Impersonate` button, you will be redirected to the dashboard of the user you are impersonating. 
In the upper section, you will see the name of the user you are impersonating. Additionally, you will see a button to exit 
the impersonation and return to your own account.

## Advantage  of Impersonate

There are a number of reasons why you might want to impersonate a user:

To help another user troubleshoot an issue. If your user roles are configured differently, it's possible that your
UI will look different from theirs and you'll need to impersonate the other user to be able to see what they see.

You want to make changes on behalf of another user (for example, the other user is away on vacation and you want to
manage their orders or run a report).

You're an administrator who's setting up user roles, and you want to preview what other users
will be able to see depending on the permissions you grant them.

You can only impersonate one user at a time.
