## Introduction

This Guide will help you to understand, how to use config variables in VaahCMS.
How we can use those variables in config file to show the necessary details to our users like app_name, VaahCMS current version,
documentation link, php_version_required etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## Usage

All those informations that we want to access in our particular module, for that
we need to go to following location:
```VaahCms/Modules/Travel/Http/Controllers/Backend/BackendController.php```

Follow below image for reference:

In the `BackendController.php` file, there is a function named as `getAssets`, this function is responsible for
accessing those `variables` defined in config file and displaying them on the front end.
