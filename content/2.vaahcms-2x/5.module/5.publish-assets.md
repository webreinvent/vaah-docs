title: Publish assets
---


## Overview
Publishing assets in a module typically refers to the process of making certain resources or files (like JavaScript, CSS, images, or other static files) available to the public or to other parts of your application. 

This functionality is particularly useful when you have access to a module but its assets are not yet available in your system.

```php
POST <public-url>/api/publish/assets/{slug}
```

## Description
This API allows you to publish the assets of a specific module, identified by its {slug}. 
Even if the module is not currently installed in your system, 
you can use this endpoint to make its assets available for use.
