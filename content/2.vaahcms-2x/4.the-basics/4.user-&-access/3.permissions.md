Permissions
---



## Purpose
Depending on their roles, the decisions made by the application owner and the system administrator, and other factors, permissions allow users to access particular aspects of the application. Permissions control which actions users are allowed to perform on your application, such as viewing, editing, and changing configuration. Each permission has a name (for example, View published material) and only permits a single activity or a small group of related actions.

## Features & Demos

#### Default Permissions

These permissions are created through seeds while set up the application.

## Methods

Some reusable methods mention bellowed.

#### `Permission::getActiveItems()`

You can use this method for fetching all active permissions of the application.

```php 
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Models\Permission;    // Import permission class at top

$active_permissions = Permission::getActiveItems();
```
---

#### `Permission::syncPermissionsWithRoles()`

You can use this method for sync permissions with roles. After creating a new permission you have to call this method to sync permissions count with roles.

```php
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Models\Permission;  // Import Role class at the top

Permission::syncPermissionsWithRoles(); 
```
---

#### `Permission::getPermissionRoles($id)`

You can use this method to retrieve roles that are associated with this permission.

```php
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Models\Permission;  // Import Role class at the top

Permission::getPermissionRoles($id);        // Permission ID must be provided as parameters.
```

## How to check if a user has permission?

VaahCms provide a method to check the User's permission.

```php
if(\Auth::user()->hasPermission('<permission_slug>'))
{
}
```
eg:

```php
if(\Auth::user()->hasPermission('has-access-of-users-section'))
{
    //user has "has-access-of-users-section" permission
}
```

#### How to get all user permission

VaahCms provide a method to get all the User's permissions.
 ```php
$all_permission =  \Auth::user()->permissions(true);    
```
### let's take an example for Laravel :-
- If you want to deny  permission from your laravel controller so you can use this code
- This code will return permission deny message.

```php
  if (!Auth::user()->hasPermission('can-update-users')) {
            $response['success'] = false;
            $response['errors'][] = trans("vaahcms::messages.permission_denied");

            return response()->json($response);
        }
```

### let's take an example for Vue :-
 - If you want to show edit button only some user's if they have permission to edit. 
   
 #### Scenario
 - you have a `Employee` module in that module there is a `employees` table and you want to show edit button if user have permission to edit.
 
 Go to `EmployeesController` =>`getAssets()` function. Add `\Auth::user()->permissions(true);` in `$data['permissions']` variable.  
 
  
 ::alert{type="info" class="flex items-center p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-blue-800 border border-blue-300 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:border-blue-800" role="alert"}
 NOTE   
`\Auth::user()->permissions(true);` this method will get all the permissions that user have.
 ::
 
 ```php
class EmployeesController extends Controller
{
    //----------------------------------------------------------
    public function __construct()
    {
    }
   //----------------------------------------------------------
 public function getAssets(Request $request): JsonResponse
    {
    
      try {
                 $data = [];
                 $data['permission'] = \Auth::user()->permissions(true);
                
```
Now go to your `vue/pages/employees/components/Table.vue`

```vue
<p v-for="permission in store.assets.permission" 
  <Button v-if=" permission == 'can-update-users' " class="p-button-tiny p-button-text"
          v-tooltip.top="'Update'"
          @click="store.toEdit(prop.data)"
          icon="pi pi-pencil"
          data-testid="employees-list_data_edit"
          />
</p>
```

## Create a Permission via VaahSeeder

Through seeds, you can generate permissions. Make a json file called `permissions.json` in the directory `../VaahCms/Modules/{module_name}/Database/Seeds/json/`.

In `permissions.json` file
```json
[

    {
        "name": "Has Access of Dashboard",
        "module": "<module_name>",
        "section": "<module_section_name>",
        "details": "This will allow user to see the link of dashboard."
    },
    {
        "name": "Has Access of Setting Section",
        "module": "vaahcms",
        "section": "Setting",
        "details": "This will allow user to see the link of setting section."
    }
]
```

To run this seed, you have to add some code in `DatabaseTableSeeder.php` at `.../VaahCms/Modules/{module_name}/Database/Seeds/` this directory.



In `DatabaseTableSeeder.php` file

```php
<?php
namespace VaahCms\Modules\<module_name>\Database\Seeds;


use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Libraries\VaahSeeder;

class DatabaseTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        VaahSeeder::permissions(__DIR__.'/json/permissions.json');
    }

}
```

You need to reactivate the `Module` in order to run Seeder. Watched attached video for more information.

- Visit following url to see new added Permissions.   
`<public-url>/backend#/vaah/permissions`

#### Assign Permissions to Role

You can add permissions to a role in permissions section. By clicking on role column, a page will open that contain list of roles along with `Yes/NO` button.

## API

VaahCMS has APIs for every method, allowing you to interact with `NuxJS` or other frameworks.

You can access APIs method from `vaachms/Http/Controllers/Api/PermissionsController.php` and routes from `vaahcms/Routes/api/api-routes-permissions.php`

        options
    );
},
