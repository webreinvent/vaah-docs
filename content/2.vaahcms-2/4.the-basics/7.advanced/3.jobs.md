## How to use job in VaahCMS

### Step-1 Configure The Queue
Let’s take an example for a better understanding. We will create an email queue using the Laravel Queue and store all the email sending jobs in the database driver.

```Command “queue:table” helps you to use the database driver for the queue.```
```shell
php artisan queue:table
```
To set a queue driver in environment file open the `.env` file to set the value like below:

```text
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```
To create a Queue Job run below command:

```shell
php artisan make:job MatchSendEmail
```
In ```app/Jobs``` you can see the code like below:

```php
<?PHP
namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class MatchSendEmail implements ShouldQueue
{
     use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

       /**
       * Create a new job instance.
       *
       * @return void
       */
    public function __construct()
  {
               //
   }

       /**
       * Execute the job.
       *
       * @return void
       */
     public function handle()
     {
            //
      }
 }
```
### Step-2 Create An Email Template And Mailable

To create mailable, run below command:

```shell
php artisan make:mail HelloEmail
```

After this command  the ```Mail``` folder will be created along with the ```HelloEmail.php``` file in the ```app``` folder.
code structure:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Content;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Envelope;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class HelloEmail extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    /**
     * Create a new message instance.
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        //
    }

    /**
     * Get the message envelope.
     */
    public function envelope(): Envelope
    {
        return new Envelope(
            from:'from@example.com',
            subject: 'Subject',
        );
    }

    /**
     * Get the message content definition.
     */
    public function content(): Content
    {
        return new Content(
            view: 'view.name',
        );
    }

    /**
     * Get the attachments for the message.
     *
     * @return array<int, \Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Attachment>
     */
    public function attachments(): array
    {
        return [];
    }
}

```
Now you need to create a folder called “emails” in the “resources/views” folder and create the file named “hello.blade.php” in the “email” folder. It will contain the simple HTML code below:

```php
<h1>Hello,</h1>
<p>Welcome to laravel platform.</p>
```
Now you need to change the “view.name” text with the newly created email view file name along with the folder name in “HelloEmail.php” like below:

```php
return $this->view('emails.hello');
```
Also, you need to add the email sending logic in the “handle()” method in the ```app/Jobs/MatchSendEmail.php``` file. But first, we need to add “Mail” and “HelloMail” namespaces to use it in the logic.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Jobs;

use Mail;
use App\Mail\HelloEmail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class MatchSendEmail implements ShouldQueue
{
use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

/**
* Create a new job instance.
*
* @return void
*/
public function __construct()
{
//
}

/**
* Execute the job.
*
* @return void
*/
public function handle()
{
$email = new HelloEmail();
Mail::to('test@test.com')->send($email);
}
}
```
### Step-3 Testing

Add the below line in your `routes/web.php file.`

```php
Route::get('send-test-email', 'EmailController@sendEmail');
```
Add a new controller file called “EmailController.php” file in the ```app/Http/Controllers/``` folder. The Code of the file will look like this.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Jobs\MatchSendEmail;

class EmailController extends Controller
{
public function sendEmail()
{
$emailJob = new MatchSendEmail();
dispatch($emailJob);
}
}
```
Then visit url
```http request
<project_url>/send-test-email
```
And  it will add the job in the “jobs” table.
## How to run method in jobs
### Step-1 create a job 
To create a Queue Job run below command:
```php
php artisan make:job RunMethods
```
In app/Jobs you can see the code like below:

```php
<?PHP
namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class RunMethods implements ShouldQueue
{
     use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

       /**
       * Create a new job instance.
       *
       * @return void
       */
    public function __construct()
  {
               //
   }
    protected function start() {
        // your start logic
    }

    protected function stop() {
        // your stop logic
    }

    protected function process() {
        // will be overrittten
    }

       /**
       * Execute the job.
       *
       * @return void
       */
     public function handle()
     {
          $this->start();
          $this->process();
          $this->stop();
      }
 }
```
### Step-2 Testing
Add the below line in your `routes/web.php` file.
```php
Route::get('run-method', 'JobMethdController@sendEmail');
```
Add a new controller file called “JobMethodController.php” file in the app/Http/Controllers/ folder. The Code of the file will look like this.
```php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Jobs\RunMethods;

class JobMethodController extends Controller
{
public function sendEmail()
{
$jobMethod = new RunMethods();
dispatch($jobMethod);
}
}
```

## How to run jobs from database
- Priority to run jobs :- `high` , `medium` , `low` and `default` these are the order of execution of the jobs. 
```php
php artisan queue:work --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=env_filename
```
If you want to run without cache use following command:
```php
php artisan queue:listen --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=env_filename
```
```php
php artisan queue:listen --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=develop
```
::alert{type="info"}
Note   
If you make any changes in code of your Job class, then you must restart the `queue:work` command.
