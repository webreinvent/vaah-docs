# Roles


## Purpose
A role is a group of permissions that allow a user who has been given the role to carry out specific actions. For instance, the super administrator, who can be regarded as the application's owner, is permitted to carry out all tasks in the application. They can add users, remove or edit, and do other things.

## Features & Demos

## Create a Roles via VaahSeeder

User can create a role through seeds. Create a json file of name `roles.json` at `.../VaahCms/Modules/{module_name}/Database/Seeds/json/` this directory.   
`roles.json`

```php
[

    {
        "name": "Clients",
        "details": "Can login to backend dashboard",
        "count_users": 0,
        "count_permissions":0      
    },
    {
        "name": "Customers",
        "details": "Frontend user to manage account",
        "count_users": 0,
        "count_permissions":0   
    }
]
```
To run this seed, you have to add some code in `DatabaseTableSeeder.php` at `.../VaahCms/Modules/{module_name}>/Database/Seeds/` this directory.   
`DatabaseTableSeeder.php`

```php
<?php
namespace VaahCms\Modules\{module_name}\Database\Seeds;


use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Libraries\VaahSeeder;

class DatabaseTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        VaahSeeder::roles(__DIR__.'/json/roles.json');
    }

}
```

- For run seeder `Deactivate` and `Active` your module.
- Visit following url to see new added roles.
`<public-url>/backend#/vaah/roles`
