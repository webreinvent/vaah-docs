# Users


## Purpose

A system for authenticating users and storing users information is called as user management. You can manage every aspect of your user accounts in `VaahCMS`, including altering user properties, resetting passwords, enabling or disabling users, and more.

## Features & Demos

##### Create a User
In VaahCMS there are two methods of creating a user
1. From Registrations
2. From Users

Follow below image for reference:
<img src="http://img-v5.getdemo.dev/screenshot/61RgXKd151.png">
You will get to know about both these methods one by one.

##### Method 1 : From Registrations

The purpose of this method  is to identify the actual user before saving their details into `users` table. Once the user is verified then their details will be saved in the `users` table in the database.   
To know more about this method, [click here](/vaahcms-2/the-basics/user-and-access/registrations).

##### Method 2 : From Users

To create a user from this method  you just need to click on `Create` button present in the top right corner of the `Users` section.

Follow below image for reference:
