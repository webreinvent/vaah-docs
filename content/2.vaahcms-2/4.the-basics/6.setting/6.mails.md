# Mails

In VaahCMS there are two ways by which we can send mails.
1. Send mails without Laravel Queues
2. Send mails with laravel Queues
### 1. Send mails without Laravel Queues


If you want to send your mails immediately , then you just need to use the following 
code snippet into your `php` file.

```php
VaahMail::send($mail, $to, $cc, $bcc);
```
- `$mail` should be an instance of Laravel Mail `Illuminate\Mail\Mailable` class.

- `$to`   is list of recipients in array format.

- `$cc`   is the list of cc recipients in array format.

- `bcc`   is list of `bcc` recipients in array format.
### 2. Send mails with laravel Queues
::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
By default, `VaahCMS` does not use Laravel queues/jobs to schedule the mail. Hence, mails will be send immediately.
::
 For sending mails with laravel Queues, first you need to Setup Laravel Queues for VaahCMS.

--------
#### Steps to Setup laravel Queues :

1. Set `QUEUE_CONNECTION` to `database` in your active `env` file

2. Visit `Setting > General > Site Settings > Laravel Queues` in your `backend dashboard` and enable it.

3. Run or setup `cron/daemon` job for 
 ```php
php artisan queue:work --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=env_filename
```
 If you want to run without cache use following command:

```
php artisan queue:listen --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=env_filename
```
eg:

```
php artisan queue:listen --queue=low --env=.env.test
```

If you make any changes in code of your `Job` class, then you must restart the `queue:work` command.

#### Send a generic mail   

Step 1. To send a generic mail, you just need to copy the below code snippet into your php file.
```php
VaahMail::dispatchGenericMail($subject, $message, $to, $from_email, 
                              $from_name, $cc, $bcc, $priority);
```
Following are the parameters that we need to define to send a generic mail in vaahcms.

| Name          | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$subject`    | Subject of the email                                         |
| `$message`    | Content of the message, it can have `html` tags              |
| `$to`         | List of recipients in array format.                          |
| `$from_email` | From email, if it's not set, then it will try to get the `domain` from `APP_URL` and add `noreply`. Eg: `noreply@<domain>` |
| `$from_name`  | From name, if it's not set, the name will be taken from `APP_NAME` |
| `$cc`         | List of `cc` recipients in array format.                     |
| `$bcc`        | List of `bcc` recipients in array format.                    |

Step 2. When you run your code a job will be created in `jobs` table in database, you will need to run the following command to run the created jobs from jobs table.
```php
php artisan queue:listen --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=env_filename
```
when you run this command, the job will be removed from the `jobs` table and mail will be sent.

#### Send Laravel mails 

```php
VaahMail::dispatch($mail, $to, $cc, $bcc, $priority);
```

- `$mail` should be an instance of Laravel Mail `Illuminate\Mail\Mailable` class.   
   Command to create mailable class in laravel   
```php
php artisan make:mail className
```
  e.g
```php
php artisan make:mail HelloEmail
```
 After you run this command a class named `HelloEmail` will be created in `app/Mail` directory.
Then your mailable class should look like this
<img src="http://img-v5.getdemo.dev/screenshot/JZ3Eiy2hon.png">
As you can see there is a file named `hello.blade.php` file in views directory, this file contains
the code used to define the content of the email.   
Follow Below image for reference:
<img src="http://img-v5.getdemo.dev/screenshot/R62mDR5AzM.png">

Now you need to create an instance of `mailable` class and 
use the method `VaahMail::dispatch`.   
Follow below image for reference:
<img src="http://img-v5.getdemo.dev/screenshot/GCFHUZhgjQ.png">

Once you run your code a job will be created in `jobs` table in database, 
to run the jobs use any of the methods defined above.
- `$to` is the array of recipient:

- `$priority` it is the order of execution of the jobs. You can provide following values `high`, `medium` `low` & `default`

------

#### Send mail to a user

```php
$user = User::find(1);
VaahMail::dispatchToUser($mail, $user, $cc, $bcc, $priority);
```

- `$user` is an instance of `WebReinvent\VaahCms\Entities\User`

---

#### Send a mail to Super Administrators 

```php
User::notifySuperAdmins($subject, $message);
```



---

### Customizing The Templates

To customize the default Laravel mail & notification template you must publish the asset, using following commands:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-mail
```

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-notifications
```




This will publish files under `resources/views/vendor/mail` directory. To update the UI of the VaahCMS `Mails`, you can edit following file:

```
resources/views/vendor/mail/html/header.blade.php
```

```
resources/views/vendor/mail/html/footer.blade.php
```

```
resources/views/vendor/mail/html/themes/default.css
```
