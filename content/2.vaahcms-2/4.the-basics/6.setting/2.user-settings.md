# User settings

## Introduction
User setting basically deals with the fields and data we are asking to user at the time of registration of user or when we create a new user. Here we can manipulate the fields' visibility.

Below image is showing you the accordions which we get when we click on ```User Settings``` in Settings Section:

#### Fields

Inside this section some predefined fields are there. By default, the following fields are visible when we create a new user or register a user .
If you want to hide these fields when you create a new user activate the toggle button present in the `Is Hidden` column.

#### Custom Fields

This feature will help us to add custom fields in our form. Suppose we need Aadhar Number for which there is no field, in that case we can create it using custom fields accordion.

Third `Trash` button is to remove added fields form the `Custom Fields` list.

The text field present is to write the name of the field so that it will dispaly in form with that name dynamically.
