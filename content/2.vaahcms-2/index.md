But if you want to use the true potential of VaahCMS and want to develop enterprise level applications, then you must learn following technologies:

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/): Vue.js is an open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/): Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js. It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze.
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/): Pinia is a store library for Vue, it allows you to share a state across components/pages.
- [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/): PrimeVue is a rich set of open source UI components for Vue.
