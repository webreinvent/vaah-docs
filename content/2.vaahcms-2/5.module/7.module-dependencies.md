# Module Dependencies

## Introduction

This guide will help you to understand how we can make sure `modules` in `VaahCMS` are dependent on each other.

## Usage

### Step 1:
You need to go to following path in our project:   
`<module-root-folder>\Http\Controllers\Backend\SetupController.php`

### Step 2:
In this file after scrolling down you will be able to find a function named as `dependencies()` .   

Follow below image for reference:

### Step 3:
Basically `dependencies` function of `SetupController.php` is called whenever we activate a module.

Here in ``` $response['data']['modules'] ``` variable we need to pass the array of `modules`.

Suppose you have two modules 1. `Travel` 2. `Sample`

Lets consider that  `Travel` module is dependent on `Sample` module i.e `Travel` module is of no use without `Sample` module.
Then you need to pass the `Sample` module as an array in `$response['data']['modules'] variable.

 ```php
 public static function dependencies()
    {
        $response['success'] = true;
        $response['data']['modules'] = ['Sample'];
        $response['data']['themes'] = [];

        return vh_response($response);
    }

```


### Step 4:
Now if you try to activate the `Travel` module without activating the `Sample` module, you will get an 
error message stating that `Sample` module is not activated yet.
