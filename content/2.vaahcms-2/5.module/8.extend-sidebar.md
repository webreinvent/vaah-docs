# Extend Sidebar

## Introduction

This guide will help you to understand how to extend sidebar menu of VaahCMS.

## Usage
To extend Sidebar of VaahCMS, you need to go to following path:   
`<module-root-folder>\Http\Controllers\Backend\ExtendController.php`

In `ExtendController.php`  file after scrolling down, you will see a function `sidebarMenu()`.
This function is responsible for extending Sidebar of VaahCMS.

Suppose you want to add a link for your `CRUD` then you just need to add the required variables in
the array named as `$links`.   
Follow below image for reference:

As you can see in the image there is a link for the `CRUD` and this array also takes three variables from us to
reflect it in Sidebar.
1. `icon` -  You can change the Module icon from here
2. `label` - You can change the Label for the Icon from here
3. `link` -  You can change the link for the Module from here

Lets suppose, if you want to change the `label` name from `Travel` to `Yatra` then just change the `label` name from 
the `sidebarMenu` function.
