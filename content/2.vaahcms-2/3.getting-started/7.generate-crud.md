# Generate Basic CRUD 

## Introduction

This is a guide to generating crud in VaahCms. We are taking an example of a Blog site.
Before jumping to the CRUD part project should have generated the module and activated it.
For the module and theme set up follow below link:-
[https://github.com/webreinvent/vaahcli](https://github.com/webreinvent/vaahcli)

::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
To generate CRUD, you will need to mention the module name. If you don't have a module for the CRUD, you will need to create one by 
[clicking here](/vaahcms-2/getting-started/generate-module)
::

## Step-1
To update VaahCms, you first need to use the self-update command. 
use the following command for this:
```shell
npm i vaah -g
```

## Step-2
To generate CRUD, use the following command:

```shell
npx vaah cms:crud
```

## Step-3
::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
For this example, we will be using the Travel Module and the database table name will be tr_blogs.
::
During the process, you will be asked the following questions. The answers are also provided below.
``` shell
  ? For which you want to create CRUD:
  > Module - Vue3 & PrimeVue...................................................0
    Module - Vue2 & Buefy......................................................1
    Theme......................................................................2
    Custom Path - Vue3 & PrimeVue..............................................3
 ```
``` shell
  Enter the Module/Theme/Entity name : Travel
 ```

``` shell
  Enter the section name (Backend | Frontend or Folder name):  (Backend)
 ```
``` shell
  Vue folder name/path:  (Vue)
 ```
::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
Always prefix your `table` name with first two-three letters of `module` name so that it would be easy for you to identify the
tables related to your module. For example if your module name is `Travel` and you want to create a CRUD for 
blogs then it would be better to use table name as `tr_blogs`.
::

``` shell
  Enter your database table name:  tr_blogs
 ```

``` shell
  Do you want to generate migration file (true/false):  (true)
 ```
``` shell
  Enter your model name (singular):  Blog
 ```
``` shell
  Enter your controller name (plural):  Blogs
 ```

## Step-4
Next, write the migrations according to the schema and reactivate the module to run the migration.
You can use the link below to access the module in your browser.
```http request
<public-url>/backend#/vaah/modules/
```
## Step-5
Include the laravel router file in the module's route file

```VaahCms/Modules/Travel/Routes/backend.php```

use the following code snippet in the path mentioned above.
```php
include('backend/routes-blogs.php');
```

## Step-6
Include the vue router file in following path

```VaahCms/Modules/Travel/Vue/routes/routes.js```

Please ensure that your code is structured as follows.
``` js
let routes= [];

import dashboard from "./vue-routes-dashboard";
import blog from "./vue-routes-blogs"; // add this line in above path

routes = routes.concat(dashboard);
routes = routes.concat(blog); // add this line in above path

export default routes;
```

## Step-7
Add Crud link to your Module Dashboard

```modules/Travel/Vue/components/Aside.vue```

Please ensure that your code is structured as follows.

```js
const items = ref([
    {
        label: 'Travel',
        items: [
            {
                label: 'Dashboard',
                icon: 'fa-regular fa-chart-bar',
                to: "/"
            },
            {
                label: 'blogs',
                icon: 'fa-regular fa-chart-bar',
                to: "/blogs"
            },

        ]
    },
]);
```

## Step-8
::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
This step is mandatory only if you have added extra columns in migration file.
::

Update fillable Columns of your `Model` file  according to your database table schema.

## Step-9
Visit the following url to access the dashboard of `Blog` CRUD.   

```<public-url>/backend/travel#/```

# Additional Steps

After creating CRUD scaffolding and configuration, we have the following recommendations:

1. Create all relationships in the model
2. Create all `accessors` and `appends` if required in the model
3. In the controller `empty_item` should have all the relationships, accessors and appends
4. You must match `<url>/{id}` object with `empty_item` object at all times
5. In the `Form` component, you should always use `store.item.<field_name>` in `v-model`
