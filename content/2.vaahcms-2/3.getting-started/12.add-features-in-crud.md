# Add Feature in Crud


## Purpose

VaahCms offers a multitude of features when you're creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. Beyond its built-in capabilities, 
VaahCms provides the flexibility to seamlessly integrate your own custom features into the CRUD system.
This means you can enhance the functionality provided by the built-in VaahCms CRUD, including features like filtering the list based on status (e.g., active or inactive), 
sorting the list in ascending or descending order, and accessing additional capabilities such as managing trashed items, among numerous others.

## Features & Demos

The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality offers a wide range of features, including the ability to display all data. Furthermore, 
it provides `bulk actions` that allow you to delete multiple pieces of data with a single click and update data, offering the following features:

- Create a New `Data`
- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Data`.
- Clone `Data` details.
- Autofill `Data` fields.
- Sort the `Data` list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Data`.
- List All existing `Data`.
- Filter the `Data` list by searching using different `fields`.
- Filter the `Data` list by different status, including trashed `Data`.
- Delete an existing `Data`.
- Delete or temporarily trash an already existing `Data`.
