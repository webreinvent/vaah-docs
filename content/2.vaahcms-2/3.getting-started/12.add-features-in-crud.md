# Add Feature in Crud


## Purpose

VaahCms offers a multitude of features when you're generating  a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. Beyond its built-in capabilities, 
VaahCms provides the flexibility to seamlessly integrate your own custom features into the CRUD system.
This means you can enhance the functionality provided by the built-in VaahCms CRUD, including features like filtering the list based on status (e.g., active or inactive), 
sorting the list in ascending or descending order, and accessing additional capabilities such as managing trashed items, among numerous others.

## Features & Demos

The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality offers a wide range of features, including the ability to display all data. Furthermore, 
it provides `bulk actions` that allow you to delete multiple pieces of data with a single click and update data, offering the following features:

- Create a New `Data`
- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Data`.
- Clone `Data` details.
- Autofill `Data` fields.
- Sort the `Data` list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Data`.
- List All existing `Data`.
- Filter the `Data` list by searching using different `fields`.
- Filter the `Data` list by different status, including trashed `Data`.
- Delete an existing `Data`.
- Delete or temporarily trash an already existing `Data`.

## Overview Of Crud

The first time you generate `CRUD` in `VaahCms`, it will appear like this: at the top, 
you'll find your `CRUD` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new data,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.

At the bottom, you'll find two toggle menus, each offering distinct features. 
The first menu allows you to perform specific actions on individual data entries, such as `activation`, `deactivation`, `deletion`, and `trashing`.

The other menu provides `bulk actions`, enabling you to perform actions on multiple data entries at once, such as deleting all data or activating all data. Additionally, in the right corner, 
there is a search bar that allows you to search for specific data in the list. Further options include a filter button and a filter reset button for data filtering.

At the bottom, you'll find a table with column names, and there's also a pagination section. 
You have the option to customize the pagination according to your preference. 
By default, it displays 20 data entries per page, but you can adjust this setting to determine how many data entries you want to see on a single page. 
It's entirely up to you.

## Add Field In Crud Form

Initially, when you generate a CRUD, the form includes only two data fields: `Name` and `Slug` 
The form becomes accessible when you click on the `Create` button. 
You can refer to the image below for an illustration of the `CRUD` form:

###  Email Field to a Form

Now, in this section, we will guide you through the process of adding a new data field, specifically 'Email,' to the existing form. 
You can follow these step-by-step instructions to seamlessly integrate this additional field into the form.

### Adding a Field in the Migration

When you attempt to create a new field in a form, the data entered into that field needs to be stored in the database.
This is essential because when you want to view or update that data later on, it should be readily accessible. To achieve this,
you add the field name to the database migration, ensuring that the database structure accommodates the new field and its data.

Now, you need to incorporate the newly added field's name into the CRUD model's 'fillable' property. 
This step is crucial to ensure that the field can be properly managed within the CRUD functionality. 
By adding the field name to the 'fillable' property, you explicitly specify that the field can accept and store data. 
This enables seamless interaction with the field when working with the CRUD operations.

NOTE   
Please deactivate and then activate your module from the backend.
This action is crucial as it initiates the creation of a new column in the database table for the newly added field. 
Deactivating and reactivating the module refreshes its database schema, ensuring that recent changes, like adding a new field, are reflected in the database. 
If you're unsure how to do this, follow these steps: Click on 'Extend' > 'Module,' choose the relevant module, and click 'Deactivate,' then 'Activate

### Add Feild In Form.Vue File

Now, you need to incorporate the 'Email' field into the 'form.vue' file where the form is rendered. 
This addition allows users to fill in their email when interacting with the form. By including the 'Email' field in the form's Vue component,
you enable users to input their email information as part of the data they provide within the form. You can refer to the image below for an illustration

::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
We are utilizing the same form for both updating and creating data. 
When you click on the 'Update' button within a table, you are directed to the update form. 
In this form, you will also find the 'Email' field, which allows you to view and potentially modify the email information associated with the data you are updating.
