### Step 4: Directory Structure

<img src="/images/themes/directory-structure.png" alt="directory-structure">

- Config:
  
  <img src="/images/themes/config-directory.png" alt="theme-config-directory">

  Config file is present here. Config file contains all the information related to theme, that was provided while creating theme, such as, name, description, `is_migratable`, `is sample data available` etc.
  And this information can be changed in this config file.

  <img src="/images/themes/config.png" alt="theme-config-file">

- Database:

  <img src="/images/themes/database-directory.png" alt="theme-database-directory">

  All the Factory, Migrations and Seeds files of this theme are present in Database Folder.

    - To generate Migration File:
      ```terminal
       npx vaah cms:t-make migration <theme-folder-name> <migration-name> 
      ```
      example:-
      ```terminal

- To generate Seeds File:
  ```terminal
   npx vaah cms:m-make seed <theme-folder-name> <seeder-name>
  ```

  Seeds file will be generated under `Database/Seeders`. Or we can use json files to seed data into tables.
  To use a json file, create a json file under `<theme-folder>/Database/Seeds/json` folder. 
  Example:

  <img src="/images/themes/json-seed-file.png" alt="theme-json-seed-file">

  and this json file can be used in SampleDataTableSeeder

  and to run `SampleDataTableSeeder` file, click on `import sample data` button:-
  <img src="/images/themes/seed-button.png" alt="theme-sample-seeder-button">
