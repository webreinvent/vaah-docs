NOTE:   
In this tutorial we will be generating `Article` theme and will also generate auth for it.
::

## Step-1
Firstly you need to update VaahCms self update
Use below command for that :
```shell
npm install vaah -g
```
Then install theme using below command :
```shell
npx vaah cms:t
```
After running this command, it will ask you following questions, answers also mentioned in `highlighted` text here:

- Name of The Theme you want to create. For example Article.
```
Enter your theme name:  Article
```
- Title of the Theme. For example Theme for Article.
```
Enter meaningful title for your theme:  Theme for Article
```

- Detailed Description about the Theme.
```
Enter your theme description:  This theme will be for Articles only
```
- Name of the person creating the Theme or press enter to go with default value provided.
```
Enter Author name:  vaah
```
- Email of the author or press enter to go with default value.
```
Enter Author email:  support@vaah.dev
```
- Author website and download url or Press Enter for default value.
```
Enter author website:  https://vaah.dev
Enter download url: 
```
Enter `true` if you want to run migration for this theme as soon as the theme
is activated else select `false`.
```
Do you want to run migration when activated (true/false):  true
```


Once this step is complete, it will generate a new folder at `VaahCMS > Themes > Article`.

Now, you actually activate the theme by visiting following URL:


```http request
<public-url>/backend#/vaah/themes/
```


Once, the theme is activated, you will be able to see the `Article` theme on Public url.

```http request
<public-url>
```

```

## Step-3
- Now in terminal it will show some procedure which we have to follow them.

```
Following steps:
1) Include Routes/frontend/routes-auth.php in Routes/frontend.php of the theme
2) Include VueScripts.js in webpack.mix.js, sample code is below:
    //To js minification
    let jses = [
        './../Resources/assets/js/VueScripts.js',
    ];

    mix.js(jses,  output_folder+'/build/script.js');
3) Include the CSS in <head> tag of master/default blade layout of the theme if not included:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.3/css/bulma.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/buefy/dist/buefy.min.css">

4) Include the JS script before </body> tag of master/default blade layout of the theme if not included:

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios@0.21.1/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.6.14/dist/vue.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/buefy/dist/buefy.min.js"></script>
    <script src="{{vh_theme_assets_url("Article", "build/script.js")}}"></script>
5) Run npm run dev in the root folder of the theme
6) Now, following routes will be available:
a) <public-url>/signin
