# Develop Theme

--------------
##### Introduction

The purpose of this tutorial is to develop a VaahCMS Theme for the management of blog with CMS Module.



##### Step 1: Install VaahCMS

Steps to install VaahCMS is available at [Getting Started > Installation](/vaahcms-2/getting-started/installation)



##### Step 2: Install VaahCLI

Install NodeJs package `VaahCLI` globally, instructions are available at [VaahCLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vaah).

```shell
npm i vaah -g
```



VaahCLI will help you to quickly generate `Module` & `Theme` scaffolding.

You can effectively use the tool with `Command Generator` at [Generators](/vaahcms-2/generators).



##### Step 3: Generate Theme
::: warning NOTE
Let's call the theme as `BlogTheme`. Open the command line tool & navigate to the project root folder or in PHPStorm open `Terminal` and to generate scaffolding for the theme, use following command:
:::
```shell
npx vaah cms:theme
```


It will ask you following questions, answers also mentioned in `red` color:

- Enter your theme name: `BlogTheme`
- Enter meaningful title for your theme: `Theme for Blog`
- Enter your theme description: `Blog`
- Enter Author name: `Vaah`
- Enter Author email: `support@vaah.dev`
- Enter author website: `https://vaah.dev`
- Enter download URL: (don't enter anything, just press enter)
- Do you want to run migration when activated (true/false): `true`
- Will your theme contains sample data (true/false): `true`

Once this step is complete, it will generate a new folder at `VaahCMS > Themes > BlogTheme`.

Now, you actually activate the theme by visiting following URL:


```http request
<public-url>/backend#/vaah/themes/
```


Once, the theme is activated, you will be able to see the "BlogTheme" on Public url.

```http request
<public-url>
```

You will see the view generated from the following blade file

```
../<project-name>VaahCms/Themes/<theme-name>/Resources/views/frontend/pages/index.blade.php
```
