# Activating Themes

------

Now, we are going to add cms codes in our blade file. It is very simple to work with these codes.

First, You need to activate the `theme` by visiting following url:

```http request
<public-url>/backend#/vaah/themes/
```

Once, the theme is activated, you will be able to see the "Cms" menu item in the `Sidebar`.
