## Overview
Effective product stock management is crucial for any e-commerce platform. In **Vaahstore**, the purpose of stock management is to ensure 
that product availability is accurately reflected, 
allowing customers to make informed purchasing decisions while minimizing the risk of overselling or **out of stock**.

## Importance

Product stocks are important for businesses as they help in managing and tracking the availability of
`products`. By keeping track of `product stocks`, businesses can ensure that they have enough inventory to
meet customer demand and avoid stockouts.

## Product Management
**Adding and Managing Inventory**

In Vaahstore, you can easily add and manage stocks through a user-friendly interface. Each stock entry includes essential details such as product name,product variation name,
warehouse name, stock quantity, status and is active. The system provides tools for updating stock levels, ensuring that all details are current and accurate.

    NOTE

      **Aggregated Stock Calculation:** Vaahstor calculates the cumulative stock for a product by summing the stock levels of all its variations associated with a particular vendor.

## Cart Management

**Real-Time Stock Updates**
- **Stock Reservation:** When items are added to a customer's cart, Vaahstor reserves the stock temporarily. This reservation helps prevent issues where items may become unavailable due to other customers’ purchases. 
- **Availability Checks:** The system continuously checks stock availability and updates the cart if there are any changes, ensuring customers are aware of the current stock status.

**Cart Synchronization**
- **Inventory Synchronization:** The shopping cart is synchronized with real-time stock levels. If an item’s stock level changes, the cart reflects this change to prevent customers from purchasing items that are no longer available. 
- **Stock Information:** Customers receive up-to-date information about product availability, which enhances the shopping experience and reduces the likelihood of order issues.

## Order Management
**Processing Orders**
- **Real-Time Updates:** When an order is placed, Vaahstor immediately updates stock levels to reflect the sale. This real-time adjustment prevents overselling by ensuring that inventory counts are accurate. 
- **Order Fulfillment:** The system handles the reduction in stock quantities automatically, streamlining the process from order placement to fulfillment.
