### Important Note

**Category Hierarchy Restriction:**

- **Circular Reference Prevention:** It is not allowed to move a category under one of its own child categories. For example, 
if "Electronics" is a parent category and "Smartphones" is a child category under "Electronics," you cannot move "Electronics" to be a child 
category of "Smartphones." This restriction prevents circular references and maintains a logical and consistent category hierarchy.

**Example:**

- **Valid Hierarchy:**
  - **Electronics**
    - **Smartphones**

- **Invalid Hierarchy:**
  - **Smartphones**
    - **Electronics** (This would create a circular reference as "Electronics" is a parent of "Smartphones" but is also a child of "Smartphones.")

This restriction ensures that the category hierarchy remains clear and unambiguous, preventing potential issues with data integrity and navigation.

## Filters
**Meaning:** In VaahStore, filters are criteria used to narrow down search results or data in a list or table. They help users specify attributes or values to display only the relevant information.


#### Filter By Date:
- Choose a date range (from and to) in the Date filter.
```
"url": "http://example.com/store-dev/public/backend/store#/categories?page=1&rows=20&filter[date][]=2024-09-10&filter[date][]=2024-09-12"
```
- Records will be filtered based on the "created_at" column falling within the specified date range.

```
  "url": "http://example.com/store-dev/public/backend/store#/categories?page=1&rows=20&filter[category][]=smartphones&filter[category][]=laptops"
```
- Records will be filtered based on the "category" column, showing only those that match the selected categories (e.g., "smartphones" and "laptops")..

#### Other General Filters in VaahCRUD

- **Sort By:** Allows you to sort records based on selected attributes (e.g., ascending, descending).
- **Is Active:** Filters records based on their active status (only active, only inactive).
- **Trashed:** Filters records that have been marked as trashed (included trashed,Exclude trashed, none).

## Categories With Products
#### Usage in Combination
When using categories and products together in VaahStore:
1. **Create a Category:** Begin by creating categories that will serve as containers for products.
2. **Create Products:** Assign products to categories by specifying the category_id when creating or updating products.
   <img src="/images/vaahstore/categories/category-with-products.png" alt="category-use-with-products.png">
     - In VaahStore, products can be assigned to multiple categories. This functionality is managed through a tree select component, allowing for a structured and hierarchical selection of categories.

3. **Manage Relationships:** Products can be retrieved with their associated category data, providing a clear organizational structure.
   <img src="/images/vaahstore/categories/product-categories.png" alt="product categories.png">

- **Filtering Products by Category**
   - In the product management or product listing view, you can apply filters based on categories.
   - By selecting specific categories, you can narrow down the list of products to those that belong to the chosen categories.
   - This functionality helps in quickly locating products within particular categories and managing them effectively.
   - **Example:** If you apply a filter for the "Smartphones" category, the product list will display only those products that are categorized under "Smartphones".
   ```
      "url": "http://example.com/store-dev/public/backend/store#/products?page=1&rows=20&filter[category][]=smartphones
   ```

- **Viewing Categories Associated with a Product** 
   - In the product table or product management interface, there is a "Categories" button associated with each product. 
   - Clicking this button opens a popup that displays all the categories associated with that particular product.
   - **Image Reference:**
       Popup Details:
      - **Content:** The popup lists all categories that the selected product belongs to, including both parent and sub-categories. 
      - **Functionality:** This feature allows you to quickly view and verify the categories assigned to a product without navigating away from the product management page.

5. **CRUD Operations:** Both categories and products can be individually managed, ensuring that the system remains up-to-date and reflects the latest changes.

By using these CRUD operations effectively, you can manage a comprehensive catalog of products within a structured category 
hierarchy, facilitating better organization and user navigation in VaahStore.
