you'll find  `Vendor Products ` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new Vendor Product entity,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.

The other menu provides `bulk actions`, enabling you to perform actions on multiple data entries at once, such as deleting all data or activating all data. Additionally, in the right corner,
there is a search bar that allows you to search for specific data in the list. Further options include a filter button and a filter reset button for data filtering.

At the bottom, you'll find a table with column names, and there's also a pagination section.
You have the option to customize the pagination according to your preference.
By default, it displays 20 data entries per page, but you can adjust this setting to determine how many data entries you want to see on a single page.
It's entirely up to you.

### Update Form Features

When you click on the `Update` button and the form opens, it not only provides the `Save`
functionality but also offers options such as `Trash`, `Delete`, `Save-and-New`, and more.
In the image below, you can see the various features available in the update form. we will discuss
all the feature of update form below.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/vendor-products/edit-options.png">



###  1. Save And Close

The `save and close` functionality is designed to assist you in saving your changes and closing the
updated form. The `save and close` operation functions similarly
to the `create and close` process when generating vendor products. Whether you are creating or updating,
this feature offers specific functionalities. During an update, it provides certain features,
mirroring those available during the creation of a new vendor product.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/vendor-products/save-and-close.png">


Here is the `Create and Close` functionality, visible in the image below, which is used during the creation of a vendor product.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/vendor-products/after-save-and-close.png">

###  2. Save And Clone


Similar to `save and close`, the `save and clone` functionality is employed to preserve all existing
details and data of a specific record in a new form. This design is particularly useful when certain
records share identical fields with only minor differences. Instead of recreating these records and
manually inputting all the fields, which can be time-consuming, `Vaahstore` helps you save a significant
amount of time through the `save-and-clone` functionality. This feature is available in both the
creation and update forms, and you can refer to the image below for guidance.

###  3. Save And New

`Save and New` is a novel functionality recently introduced in `Vaahstore`, offering significant
time-saving benefits. It is designed to preserve your existing data while concurrently opening a
new form, thus optimizing your time utilization. In typical scenarios, when updating records, you are
required to close the update form, and when creating a new record, you must open the create form,
involving separate steps that consume time. With `Vaahstore's` introduction of `Save and New`, you no
longer need to close the update form and then click on the create button to initiate record creation.
This innovative feature combines these two operations seamlesslyâ€”simply click on `Save and New` to
accomplish the same task efficiently.

###  4. Trash , Delete And Fill

The functionalities of `Trash`, `Delete`, and `Fill` are common, so we will elaborate on each. The
`Trash` functionality aids in trashing records, providing a temporary delete option with the ability
to restore records later. On the other hand, `Delete` performs a permanent deletion, and once a record
is deleted, it cannot be restored. The `Fill` functionality is designed to populate all fields with
dummy data. These functionalities collectively enhance the features available in the updated form.
Additionally, the create form includes a unique feature called `Reset`, allowing you to reset all
fields with a single click instead of manually removing individual entries, which can be time-consuming.

## Requirement to set a Product Variation Price

In the context of e-commerce, price is a crucial aspect of product variation.
Product variation in terms of price refers to offering different pricing options or 
tiers for a particular product or service. This pricing flexibility allows businesses 
to cater to diverse customer segments, accommodate various budget ranges, and 
implement strategic pricing strategies 


| Fields         |      | Descriptions                                      |
| ------------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Product Variation         |      |  Use this field to select the product variation for the product-vendor. you can select the active product variation accordingly.           |
| Quantity        |      |  Use this field to input the product variation price for the variation of products.            |
