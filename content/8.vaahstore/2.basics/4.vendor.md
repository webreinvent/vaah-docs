title: Vendor Crud
---

## Purpose

A vendor is a person, company, or entity that sells goods or services. In the context of business
and commerce, a vendor is often someone who supplies products or services to customers, either 
directly or through a distribution channel. Vendors can operate in various industries, providing
a wide range of goods and services.

## Understand Vendor

Imagine you're organizing a big party. You need decorations, food, and drinks.
Now, think of vendors as the different people or businesses you'd buy these things from.

### Supplier (or Seller): 
This is like the person selling balloons, streamers, and other party decorations. 
They're providing the materials you need.

### Manufacturer: 
Picture someone making custom-made cakes for your party. They take the ingredients 
(supplied by others) and create the final product.

### End-User:
That's you, the person throwing the party, using the products and services provided by 
vendors to make your event a success.

## Features & Demos

The ` Vendors` CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality offers a wide range of features,

to delete multiple pieces of  Vendors with a single click and update  Vendors, offering the following features:

- Create a New `Vendor`
- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Vendor`.
- Clone `Vendor` details.
- Autofill `Vendor` fields.
- Sort the `Vendor` list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Vendor`.
- List All existing `Vendor`.
- Filter the `Vendor` list by searching using different `fields`.
- Filter the `Vendor` list by different status, including trashed `Vendor`.
- Delete an existing `Vendor`.
- Delete or temporarily trash an already existing `Vendor`.


## Overview Of Vendor Crud

First time when  you interact with `Vendor` in `VaahStore`, it will appear like this: at the top,
you'll find  `Vendor ` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new vendor,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.
And a left-side you can access all other crud like store, vendor etc.
