## Overview
In an e-commerce backend (VaahStore), the Payments CRUD  is crucial for managing transactions, processing payments, and maintaining financial records. Hereâ€™s an overview of its purpose, usage, and other details:

## Purpose
The Payments CRUD system handles the entire lifecycle of payment transactions within an e-commerce platform (journey of a order from cart to place order). Its primary functions include:

1. **Processing Transactions:**
    - Facilitates the processing of customer payments, ensuring that orders are paid for and completed
    
2. **Tracking Payment Status:**
    - Keeps track of the payment status for each transaction, including pending, success, or failure.
3. **Managing Records:**
    - Maintain records of all payment transactions, which is essential for financial reporting and auditing also used in orders details page [order transaction history](../8.vaahstore/basics/11.orders.md#transaction-details-tab-panel){:target="_blank"}.
4. **Integration with Payment Gateways:** This functionality will implement later Currently Dealing with Cash On Delivery (COD) method.

## Usage:
- **Creating Payments:** Users can create new payment records, specifying details such as payment method, transaction ID, amount, and associated orders. 
- **Viewing Payments:** Provides a comprehensive list of all payments with key details including payment ID, amount, date, status, and associated orders. 
- **Updating Payments:** Allows modification of existing payment records to reflect changes or corrections, only updating payment notes . 
- **Deleting Payments:** Enables the removal of payment records when necessary, adhering to business rules and compliance requirements. 

## Handling Multiple Orders:
In VaahStore, a single payment can cover multiple orders. This functionality supports:
- **Multiple Orders per Payment:** Users can associate multiple orders with a single payment record. This is useful when a customer makes a single payment that covers several orders. 
- **Order-Specific Amounts:** For each order included in a payment, the form displays
   - **Payable Amount:** The total amount that can be paid towards each order. 
   - **Payment Amount:** The amount being paid for each specific order.
   - **Note:** For more detailed information on how to create payments, including step-by-step instructions and specific examples,
  please refer to the Create Payments as given below.

#### Requirements to Make a Payment
| Fields                   |   Type   | Descriptions                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Orders                     |   Array   | `List of orders that the payment is associated with.`    |
| Payment Method                   |  Object    | `Details of the payment method used, such as credit card or PayPal`         |
| Payment Notes                  |    String  | `Additional notes or comments regarding the payment.` |

### Note
In the create form, when selecting multiple orders via autocomplete, the form displays the orders along with the following amounts:
- **Payable Amount:** The total amount that can be paid for each order.
- **Payment Amount:** The amount you intend to pay for each order.
- **Total Payment:**  It is the cumulative sum of payment made for each order

**Important Validation:**
- All validations are handled on the backend. Specifically, the **Payment Amount** cannot exceed the **Payable Amount** for any order. This ensures that you can only pay up to the allowed amount for each order.
  refer to the image below for a visual representation of how these amounts are displayed in the form.
