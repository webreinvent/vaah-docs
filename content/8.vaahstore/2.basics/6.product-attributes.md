## Purpose

`Product Attributes` refer to the different characteristics or properties that a product can have. These attributes can include features,
specifications, designs, sizes, colors, or any other distinguishing factors that differentiate one product from another within a product
line. The goal of introducing `Product Attributes` is to cater to the diverse preferences, needs, and requirements of consumers, ultimately
enhancing customer satisfaction and expanding the market reach of the product as they enable businesses to provide a diverse range of options
and ensure that there is something for everyone.

## Features

The `Product Attribute` CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality offers a wide range of features,
including the ability to display all Product Attributes. Furthermore, it provides bulk actions that allow you
to delete multiple pieces of Product Attributes with a single click and update Product Attribute, offering the following features:

- Create a New `Product Attribute`
- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Product Attribute`.
- Clone `Product Attribute` details.
- Autofill the required fields while creating `Product Attribute` .
- Sort the list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Product Attribute`.
- List All existing `Product Attribute`.
- Filter the `Product Attribute` list by searching using different `fields`.
- Filter the `Product Attribute` list by different ways like product variation name, attribute name, date filter etc.
- Delete an existing `Product Attribute`.
- Delete or temporarily trash an already existing `Product Attribute`.


## Overview Of Product Attribute Crud

First time when you interact with `Product Attribute CRUD` in `VaahStore`,
you'll find  `Product Attribute ` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new product attribute,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.

The other menu provides `bulk actions`, enabling you to perform actions on multiple data entries at once, such as trashing all data, restoring all data, deleting all data. Additionally, in the right corner,
there is a search bar that allows you to search for specific data in the list. Further options include a filter button and a filter reset button for data filtering.

At the bottom, you'll find a table with column names, and there's also a pagination section.
You have the option to customize the pagination according to your preference.
By default, it displays 20 data entries per page, but you can adjust this setting to determine how many data entries you want to see on a single page.
It's entirely up to you.
