## Overview
In VaahStore, the Shipments feature is essential for managing the delivery of order items through various stages. This functionality not only tracks and updates the 
shipment status but also affects the overall status of the orders based on the quantities shipped and their corresponding statuses.

VaahStore’s Shipments feature facilitates the management of the shipping process for order items. It allows users to specify quantities
to be shipped, assign statuses to each shipment, and see how these updates affect the overall order status.

## Purpose
The Shipments functionality in VaahStore serves several key purposes:
1. **Order Fulfillment Management:**
    - **Quantity Handling:** Allows users to specify the quantity of items to be shipped for each order. This is crucial for accurate fulfillment and inventory management. 
    - **Status Assignment:** Enables assignment of shipment statuses, which directly impacts the order’s shipping status and overall order status.
2. **Order Status Update:**
    - **Shipping Status Impact:** Changes in shipment statuses (e.g., Shipped, Partially Shipped) affect the overall status of the order, providing real-time updates to customers and internal staff.
3. **Operational Efficiency:** 
    - **Streamlined Processes:** Enhances the efficiency of the shipping process by allowing precise management of quantities and statuses, thus reducing errors and delays.

## Usage
### **Creating Shipments:**
- **Multiple Orders:** When creating a shipment, users can select and include items from multiple orders. This allows for efficient processing when a single shipment covers multiple orders.
- **Specify Quantities:** When creating a shipment, users input the quantity of items to be shipped. This is crucial for reflecting the actual amount being dispatched from inventory. 
- **Assign Statuses:** Assign a status to the shipment (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Partially Shipped, Delivered). The assigned status helps track the progress and manage the fulfillment process.

- Login to the `VaahStore` admin panel.

#### Requirements to Make a Shipment
| Fields                   |   Type   | Descriptions                                      |

| Orders                     |   Array   | `List of orders associated with the shipment. Items from these orders will be included in the shipment.`    |
| Tracking Url                   |  Object    | `URL link provided by the carrier for tracking the shipment.`         |
| Tracking Key                   |  Object    | `Key or identifier used for tracking the shipment, often provided by the carrier.`         |
| Tracking Value                 |    String  | `Value or code associated with the tracking key, used to track the shipment.` |
| Status                 |    String  | `Current status of the shipment (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered).` |

**Note:** When creating a shipment for multiple orders using the autocomplete feature, the UI displays a detailed table for each selected order. The table includes the following columns:
- **Total Quantity:** The total number of items ordered. 
- **Shipped:** The quantity of items that have already been shipped. 
- **Pending:** The quantity of items that are yet to be shipped. 
- **To Be Shipped:** The quantity of items that you are currently planning to ship.


  
Refer to the image below for a visual representation of the shipment creation page:

- **Validation:** The backend performs essential validations to ensure data integrity. For example, the quantity entered in the To Be Shipped column must not exceed the Pending quantity for each item.
If you attempt to ship more items than are pending, the system will provide an error message, such as:
<span style="color:red;">To be shipped quantity for item "item-name" should not exceed the pending quantity.</span>
