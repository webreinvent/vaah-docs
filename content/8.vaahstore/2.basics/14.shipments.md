## Overview
In VaahStore, the Shipments feature is essential for managing the delivery of order items through various stages. This functionality not only tracks and updates the 
shipment status but also affects the overall status of the orders based on the quantities shipped and their corresponding statuses.

VaahStore’s Shipments feature facilitates the management of the shipping process for order items. It allows users to specify quantities
to be shipped, assign statuses to each shipment, and see how these updates affect the overall order status.

## Purpose
The Shipments functionality in VaahStore serves several key purposes:
1. **Order Fulfillment Management:**
    - **Quantity Handling:** Allows users to specify the quantity of items to be shipped for each order. This is crucial for accurate fulfillment and inventory management. 
    - **Status Assignment:** Enables assignment of shipment statuses, which directly impacts the order’s shipping status and overall order status.
2. **Order Status Update:**
    - **Shipping Status Impact:** Changes in shipment statuses (e.g., Shipped, Partially Shipped) affect the overall status of the order, providing real-time updates to customers and internal staff.
