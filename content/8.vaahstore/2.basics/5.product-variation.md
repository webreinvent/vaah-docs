title: Product Variation Crud
---

## Purpose


Product variation refers to the range of options, versions, or variations that a specific product 
can have within a product line. It involves offering customers different choices in terms of features,
specifications, designs, sizes, colors, or other attributes. The goal of introducing product variation is
to cater to the diverse preferences, needs, and requirements of consumers, ultimately enhancing customer 
satisfaction and expanding the market reach of the product.

## Features & Demos

The `Product variation` CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality offers a wide range of features,
including the ability to display all Product Variation. Furthermore, it provides bulk actions that allow you 
to delete multiple pieces of Product Variation with a single click and update Product Variation, offering the following features:

- Create a New `Product Variation`
- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Product Variation`.
- Clone `Product Variation` details.
- Autofill `Product Variation` fields.
- Sort the `Product Variation` list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Product Variation`.

## Overview Of Product Variation Crud

First time when  you interact with `Product Variation CRUD` in `VaahStore`, it will appear like this: at the top,
you'll find  `Product Variation ` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new product variation,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.
And a left-side you can access all other crud like store, vendor etc.

At the bottom, you'll find two toggle menus, each offering distinct features.
The first menu allows you to perform specific actions on individual data entries, such as `activation`, `deactivation`, `deletion`, and `trashing`.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-variation/product-variation-2.png">

The other menu provides `bulk actions`, enabling you to perform actions on multiple data entries at once, such as deleting all data or activating all data. Additionally, in the right corner,
there is a search bar that allows you to search for specific data in the list. Further options include a filter button and a filter reset button for data filtering.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-variation/product-variation-3.png">

At the bottom, you'll find a table with column names, and there's also a pagination section.
You have the option to customize the pagination according to your preference.
By default, it displays 20 data entries per page, but you can adjust this setting to determine how many data entries you want to see on a single page.
It's entirely up to you.

### Update Form Features 

When you click on the `Update` button and the form opens, it not only provides the `Save` 
functionality but also offers options such as `Trash`, `Delete`, `Save-and-New`, and more.
In the image below, you can see the various features available in the update form. we will discuss
all the feature of update form below.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-variation/product-variation-7.png">



###  1. Save And Close

The `save and close` functionality is designed to assist you in saving your changes and closing the 
updated form. The `save and close` operation functions similarly 
to the `create and close` process when generating product variations. Whether you are creating or updating, 
this feature offers specific functionalities. During an update, it provides certain features,
mirroring those available during the creation of a new product variation.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-variation/product-variation-9.png">


Here is the `Create and Close` functionality, visible in the image below, which is used during the creation of a product variation.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-variation/product-variation-8.png">

###  2. Save And Clone


Similar to `save and close`, the `save and clone` functionality is employed to preserve all existing 
details and data of a specific record in a new form. This design is particularly useful when certain
records share identical fields with only minor differences. Instead of recreating these records and 
manually inputting all the fields, which can be time-consuming, `Vaahstore` helps you save a significant
amount of time through the `save-and-clone` functionality. This feature is available in both the 
creation and update forms, and you can refer to the image below for guidance.

###  3. Save And New

`Save and New` is a novel functionality recently introduced in `Vaahstore`, offering significant
time-saving benefits. It is designed to preserve your existing data while concurrently opening a
new form, thus optimizing your time utilization. In typical scenarios, when updating records, you are 
required to close the update form, and when creating a new record, you must open the create form, 
involving separate steps that consume time. With `Vaahstore's` introduction of `Save and New`, you no 
longer need to close the update form and then click on the create button to initiate record creation.
This innovative feature combines these two operations seamlesslyâ€”simply click on `Save and New` to 
accomplish the same task efficiently.

###  4. Trash , Delete And Fill

The functionalities of `Trash`, `Delete`, and `Fill` are common, so we will elaborate on each. The 
`Trash` functionality aids in trashing records, providing a temporary delete option with the ability 
to restore records later. On the other hand, `Delete` performs a permanent deletion, and once a record 
is deleted, it cannot be restored. The `Fill` functionality is designed to populate all fields with 
dummy data. These functionalities collectively enhance the features available in the updated form. 
Additionally, the create form includes a unique feature called `Reset`, allowing you to reset all
fields with a single click instead of manually removing individual entries, which can be time-consuming.

### Quantity Range Filter 

The `Quantity` Range filter plays a crucial role in refining data based on quantity parameters. In this 
context, quantity refers to the amount available for a specific product variation, providing 
users with insights into product availability.

When engaging with the `Quantity` filter, the process involves selecting a slider for both the minimum 
and maximum values. This allows users to specify a range within which they want to filter the data.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-variation/product-variation-15.png">

Once the quantity filter is applied with the chosen slider values, the system displays relevant data 
in a table format. This filtered data represents product variations falling within the specified 
quantity range, offering users a clear and tailored view of the available information. 

### Low Stock Alert Notification System

Within the Product Variation functionality, a crucial feature is the Low Stock Alert. This function 
is designed to monitor the quantity of a particular product variation. When the stock of a specific 
product variation drops below a predefined threshold, a notification is triggered.

In this scenario, an email is automatically sent to the Super Admin, providing a detailed list of 
products that are currently experiencing low stock levels. This proactive system ensures that the 
administration is promptly informed about potential stock shortages, allowing for timely and strategic
inventory management decisions.


## Stock Status 


In the table, there is a designated column for Stock Status, reflecting the availability of stock for
each specific variation. This column displays two distinct values: `In Stock` and `Out of Stock`.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-variation/product-variation-16.png">

Here's a breakdown of the logic behind these status indicators:

### 1.In Stock

If the quantity of a particular product variation is greater than 1,
the Stock Status column will display `In Stock`. This indicates that an ample quantity of the 
variation is available.

### 2.Out of Stock: 
Conversely, if the quantity of the product variation is less than or equal to 1, 
the Stock Status column will show `Out of Stock`. This serves as an alert that the stock for that
variation has reached or fallen below the set minimum threshold.

By incorporating this Stock Status column, users can quickly assess the availability of each 
product variation within the table, facilitating efficient inventory management decisions.




## Conclusion


### Importance of Product variation 

Having different choices for the same product is super important, and that's what we call product variation. 
Imagine if there was only one kind of pizza topping â€“ not everyone would be thrilled. 
Product variation is like having different toppings or flavors for things, so everyone can pick what 
they really like. Whether it's the color of a shirt or the size of a toy, these options make sure that
there's something for everyone. It's like a store saying, "Hey, we know you're all different,
and we've got something that fits exactly what you're looking for!" So, product variation is a cool way
for businesses to make sure you can get exactly what you want, just the way you like it.


### Need Of Product Variation

Product variation is like having different options for the same thing, so everyone can find what
they like. It's important because people have different tastes and needs. For example, think about
different colors or sizes of a shirt. Some people like red, some like blue, and some like a small 
size while others prefer a large one. Businesses use product variation to make sure they have 
something for everyone. It's like having different flavors of ice cream in a shop. If you only had one
flavor, not everyone would be happy. With different options, more people can find and buy what they 
really want.
