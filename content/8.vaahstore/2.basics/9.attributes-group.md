### Update Form Features

When you click on the `Update` button and the form opens, it not only provides the `Save`
functionality but also offers options such as `Trash`, `Delete`, `Save-and-New`, and more.
In the image below, you can see the various features available in the update form. we will discuss
all the feature of update form below.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/attributes-group/edit-options.png">



###  1. Save And Close

The `save and close` functionality in attributes group operations allows users to save changes
made in the updated form and simultaneously close it. This process is akin to the `create and close` operation for generating new attribute group. Whether creating or updating, this feature
provides specific functionalities, offering similar features during updates as those available
in the creation of new attribute.



###  2. Save And Clone


Similar to `save and close`, the `save and clone` functionality is employed to preserve all existing
details and data of a specific record in a new form . This design is particularly useful when certain
records share identical fields with only minor differences. Instead of recreating these records and
manually inputting all the fields, which can be time-consuming, `Vaahstore` helps you save a significant
amount of time through the `save-and-clone` functionality. This feature is available in both the
creation and update forms, and you can refer to the image below for guidance.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/attributes-group/after-save-and-clone.png">

Here after `save and clone` option, new create form is opened with certain records as shown in above image.

###  3. Save And New

Vaahstore's new feature, `Save and New`, streamlines data management by allowing users to
preserve existing data while simultaneously opening a new form. Unlike traditional methods
that involve closing the update form and opening a create form separately, `Save and New`
combines these steps into one efficient click. This innovative functionality optimizes time
utilization, providing a seamless and time-saving experience for users updating and creating
records.

After `Save and New` option a new form is open same like `Create and New`.

###  4. Trash , Delete And Fill

In our updated form, we've introduced key functionalities to enhance user experience.
The `Trash` option enables the temporary removal of records, allowing for easy restoration.
In contrast, `Delete` permanently erases records with no recovery option. The `Fill` feature
efficiently populates all fields with dummy data, streamlining the data entry process.
