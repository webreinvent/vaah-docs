## Orders Feature in VaahStore Backend
The orders feature in vaahstore is a critical component that handles the entire lifecycle of a 
customer's purchase. It involves recording, processing, managing, and tracking orders from the moment a 
customer places an order until it is fulfilled and closed. This feature interfaces with various other systems,
such as stock management, payment processing, and shipping logistics.
