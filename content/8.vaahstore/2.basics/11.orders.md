## Orders Feature in VaahStore Backend

customer places an order until it is fulfilled and closed. This feature interfaces with various other systems,
such as stock management, payment processing, and shipping logistics.

- **Efficient Order Processing**

   - **Order Accuracy:** Maintains accurate records of customer orders to avoid errors and fulfill orders as requested.
- **Stock Management**
   - **Stock Level Updates:** Automatically adjusts stock levels based on the items purchased to prevent overselling. 
   - **Stock Availability:** Ensures that only available items can be purchased and manages backorders if necessary.
- **Payment Handling**

### Order Processing
- **Backend Handling:**

      - On the left-hand side of the confirmation page, the items (products) are displayed along with their quantity and price. On the other hand,
      - **Order Summary** displays the order creation date, the total amount paid for the order, the total order amount, the unique order ID.
      - **Shipping Details** displays the customer's shipping address provided during the checkout process, including name, city, ZIP code, state, country, and mobile number.
