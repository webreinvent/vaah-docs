# .p12 Certificate

::alert{type="success"}
Setup   
- To do the setup of remote push notification service you will need to setup one of the below thing.
  - .p12 Certificate (Refer this documentation)
  - OR [p8 Token-Based Connection to APNs](../configurations/p8_key.md)
::



## Step 1. Requirements

- An iOS mobile app. (This is not for websites / web push)
- An Apple Developer Account with Admin Role.
- A Mac computer with Xcode 11+
- Your Xcode project should have the Push Notification capability added. Otherwise your project may not be shown in the Apple Developer Center.

## Step 2. Identifier/ Provisioning

::alert{type="warning"} 
ðŸš§ Deprecated Provisionator.                
We have deprecated the Provisionator tool and recommend updating your application to instead use a .p8 token to connect to APNs.   
If you would still like to use the .p12 certificate, you can continue following this guide to generate your certificate.

::

- If you are renewing a certificate or your app already has an existing App ID or Provisioning Profile, skip to [Step 3. Generate a Push Certificate.](#step-3-generate-a-push-certificate)

- If your App does not have an existing App ID or Provisioning Profile setup, then login to your Apple Developer Account and navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles->Identifiers and select the Blue + button.

- Select App and Continue

- Provide a "Description" and your Explicit "Bundle ID". This must be the same as the "Bundle Identifier" you set for your project in Xcode.

- Press Continue and on the next page, select Register

## Step 3. Generate a Push Certificate

::alert{type="warning"} 
ðŸš§ Previous Certificate Revocation   
Previous .p12 Push Certificates for this Bundle ID will be revoked and cannot be used once you generate a new certificate with this method.

### Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority

- Open the Keychain Access App on your macOS system. It may be located in **Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access**

- Select **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...**

- Next, select the Saved to disk option and enter your information in the required fields. Then click Continue.

- This creates a certification request file that will be used later.

### Add Capabilities

- In your Apple Developer Account under Certificates, IDs & Profiles > Identifiers, select Identifiers.

- Find and select your Identifier to enable Push Notifications, but do not click Configure.

- If you do not see your Identifier, follow [Step 2. Identifier/ Provisioning.](#step-2-identifier-provisioning)

### Select Push Notification Certificate

- Go to Certificates and create a new certificate by clicking the blue + (plus) button.

- Under Services, select Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production) and click Continue.

- The certificate will be applicable to both Sandbox and Production environments, so you do not need a separate key for each one.

### Creating a Private Key

- Give the file a unique name using the .p12 extension, and click Save. You will have the option to protect the file with a password.

## Step 4. Provisioning Profiles

- Skip if selected "Automatically manage signing" in Xcode.

- If you did not select "Automatically manage signing", then follow these steps.

### Create Your Profile

- Go to your **Apple Developer Account > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Profiles.**

<img src="/images/flutter/apple-dev-portal/profile.png">

- Next find any that are for your app and remove them if they do not have App Groups and Push Notifications in Enabled Capabilities:

- Create a Profile by pressing the "+" button

<img src="/images/flutter/apple-dev-portal/profile-b.png">

- Name your Provisioning Profile.

::alert{type="success"}
Best Practices   
When creating a new profile, make sure to enter a unique name in the "Provisioning Profile Name:" field.
For example, if you are creating an Ad-Hoc Provisioning Profile to test push notifications with a Production Push Certificate .p12 file. Use the format AppName_AdHoc so you know the app and type of profile that it is.
::

- Select Generate.

- On the last page Download your profile.

- Re-sync your Developer Account in Xcode by going to **Xcode > Preferences...** then click on the "View Details..." button. Then, click the refresh button on the bottom left of the popup. See Apple's documentation for more detailed instructions.

- Make sure you pick your new provisioning profile from **Build Settings>Code Signing>Provisioning Profile** in Xcode.
