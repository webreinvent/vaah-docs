description: This document outlines key strategies and best practices for improving code consistency, performance, and maintainability in a Nuxt 3 project.

## 1. Data Fetching in Nuxt 3 — Best Practices & Common Pitfalls
When building apps with Nuxt 3, server-side rendering (SSR) introduces some nuances in how you fetch data. Missteps often cause confusing errors like **"Nuxt instance unavailable"** or result in degraded performance.

---

### a. The "Nuxt instance unavailable" error: What it means

This error typically happens because you're trying to access the Nuxt-specific composables or APIs outside of a proper Nuxt context, or before the app instance is fully created.

Common causes:

- Using `useNuxtApp` or other composables inside plain async functions or external modules that run outside component/render context.
- Trying to access runtime config via `useRuntimeConfig()` in places where the Nuxt app hasn’t been instantiated (e.g., outside setup, or during SSR before hooks).
- Accessing cookies with `useCookie()` in code that runs *too early* or outside the Nuxt lifecycle.

#### How to avoid:

- Only call composables (`useNuxtApp`, `useRuntimeConfig`, `useCookie`, etc.) inside Vue components or setup/composable functions that run during proper setup.
- Avoid calling them inside raw SSR lifecycle hooks or external utility functions unless you pass the Nuxt app instance explicitly.
- Use the `event` handler (like in server API routes or Nitro server handlers), where necessary, to get context.

---

### b. Avoid chaining multiple `await` calls in SSR data fetching

Why?

- Multiple sequential `await`s cause unnecessary delays. Each `await` pauses the execution, potentially prolonging SSR response time.
- In SSR, performance is critical because the user waits for the full server-rendered page.
- Instead, fetch in parallel where possible using `Promise.all()` or similar concurrency methods.

Example (less efficient):

```js
const user = await fetchUser();
const posts = await fetchPosts(user.id);

//Better (parallelize independent fetches):

const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([fetchUser(), fetchPosts()]);
```
If fetching posts depends on the user, you can only parallelize what’s truly independent.

### c. Don’t call useNuxtApp, useCookie, useRuntimeConfig inside:
- Pure SSR functions (like middlewares, utility modules)
- Modules that execute before Nuxt instance creation
- Composables executed outside the Vue setup context or outside component lifecycle

#### Why?
- These composables rely on Vue and Nuxt reactive contexts that are only available during component setup/render or specific Nuxt hooks.
- Calling them too early or outside these contexts causes missing instances and runtime errors.

#### Recommended alternatives:
- Use Nitro server API routes or server handlers to fetch data and pass runtime config or cookies explicitly.
- Pass the app context as an argument if you write reusable functions needing any Nuxt API.
- Use defineNuxtRouteMiddleware/defineNuxtPlugin hooks where Nuxt app is guaranteed.
- Use useCookie(event) or useRuntimeConfig(event) variants inside server routes with access to the event context.

### d. How to do data fetching correctly in Nuxt 3

#### Use useAsyncData(), useLazyAsyncData() or useFetch()
- These composables are designed for combining SSR + client-side hydration.
- They integrate seamlessly with Nuxt lifecycle, handling suspense and reactivity.
- They allow you to fetch data on server when rendering and client on navigation.

## 2. Consistent Use of `runtimeConfig`

- Use `runtimeConfig` consistently throughout the project instead of mixing `process.env` and `runtimeConfig` in different files.  
  This promotes a unified configuration approach and reduces confusion.

- You no longer need to explicitly define your environment variables inside the `runtimeConfig` section of `nuxt.config.ts` for them to be accessible at runtime. Nuxt 3 automatically picks up environment variables prefixed with `NUXT_` from your `.env` files or your system environment and injects them into the `runtimeConfig`.

### Key Points

- **Automatic Detection:**  
  Nuxt 3 reads environment variables prefixed with `NUXT_` without requiring manual configuration in `nuxt.config.ts`.

- **Simplified Configuration:**  
  You can avoid duplicating the environment variable keys and values inside the `runtimeConfig` object.

- **Security:**  
  By default, variables not prefixed with `NUXT_` are not exposed to the client-side, helping to keep sensitive information secure.

- **Runtime Flexibility:**  
  Environment variables can be changed at runtime without rebuilding the application, as Nuxt injects them dynamically.

## 3. Performance Optimization via Lazy Loading

- Disable auto-imports and prefer dynamic imports to reduce the initial build chunk size and improve load performance.
- Use [`defineAsyncComponent`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#defineasynccomponent) to lazy-load certain components.  
  Lazy-loading reduces initial bundle sizes and improves application performance.

---

## 4. Proper Cleanup of Watchers

- Watchers that are defined inside components might cause memory leaks if not stopped properly.
- **Best Practice:**  
  Ensure any watchers are stopped in the lifecycle hooks `onUnmounted` or `onBeforeUnmount`.  
  This prevents memory leaks and helps maintain application stability.

---

## 5. Error Handling and Reporting

- Surface critical errors in the UI using toasts, modals, or error banners so users are informed of failures.
- **Additional Suggestion:**  
  Consider implementing a global error handler for unexpected failures to centrally manage error reporting.

---

## 6. Configuration Management

- Critical application settings and parameters should **not** be hardcoded within the source code.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Move these configurations to a dedicated config file or expose them via environment variables.  
  This makes tuning and maintenance easier without touching source code.

---

## 7. Type Checking

- Enable type-checking during development by leveraging Nuxt 3’s built-in TypeScript support.
- Run the following to enforce type correctness and minimize runtime errors:
  ```bash
  tsc --noEmit

## 8. Pre-Commit Checklist
### a. Linting
Run the following command to check code style:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix issues, run:
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### b. Type Checking (if using TypeScript)
Ensure type correctness to reduce runtime errors by running:

```bash
tsc --noEmit
```

### c. Testing
Execute tests to confirm no failures have been introduced:

```bash
npm run test
```

### d. Formatting
Run Prettier to maintain consistent code formatting:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

## Additional Recommendations

- Add unit tests where applicable to increase test coverage and ensure reliability.
