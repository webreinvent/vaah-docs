# WebdriverIO Setup
Welcome to the WebDriverIO Setup Documentation! In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the essential steps and best practices for setting up WebDriverIO, a powerful and flexible JavaScript automation framework, to supercharge your web testing efforts.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** should be installed on your computer.
- **Knowledge of JavaScript**.
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn (npm comes bundled with Node.js)
- **Code Editor**: A code editor like VSCode or PHPStorm.
- **WebDriver-Compatible Browser**: Common choices are Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
 
## Setup WebDriverIO Project

1. Open Code Editor.
2. Create a project.
3. Run command: (This creates a node project in that folder that will have a package.json file.)
    ```shell
    npm init -y
    ```
4. Run command: (This will install webdriverIO on the project)
    ```shell
   npm init wdio
   ```
5. When the command is running, choose appropriate options based on your preference.
6. Choose **spec reporter**  for test case reporting.
7. Choose **Mocha Framework** for framework.
8. Refer the below image for all the options that are available during setup:

9. Wait for the command to complete.
10. Once the command has run successfully, It will install some directories and files on the project.
11. Verify whether the `wdio.conf.js` file are created or not.
12. There should be some sample test cases which were created during the setup. Verify the same in `test/spec/` directory. 
13. To run the test script, run command:
    ```shell
    npx run wdio
    ```
    or
    ```shell
    npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
    ```
14. To run a specific test script: Run the command:
    ```shell
    npx wdio run wdio.conf.js --spec test1.js
    ```
15. Once the sample test scripts are running successfully, you can modify and create your own scripts.

Note:
- The points in the Requirement section must be fulfilled before working on the setup.
- Carefully choose the options during the WebDriverIO setup.
- Some commands may take longer time to execute which is expected. Just wait for it to complete. 
- Previous commands must be completed successfully before running the next command.

## Mocha Framework
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.
::alert{type="warning"}
If you completed the previous steps and installed the mocha framework during setup then ignore the steps given below. This is only for those who do not add mocha during installation and want to install after setup.
::

First, install the adapter package from NPM:
```shell
npm install @wdio/mocha-framework --save-dev
```

After a successful installation of the mocha framework. Verify the `package.json` file the presence of mocha framework:
> "@wdio/mocha-framework": "^8.16.12"

#### Advantages of Mocha
1. **Feasibility:** Mocha is simple to install and get started with. It can be easily integrated into JavaScript projects, quickly incorporating testing into the development workflow.

2. **Versatility:** Mocha can be used in browser and server-side environments, making it suitable for various JavaScript applications. Mocha can efficiently test code when developing a back-end server or front-end web application.

3. **Accuracy:** Mocha generates detailed and accurate test reports, clearly indicating the success or failure of each test. Mocha provides informative error messages, and stack traces when a test fails, making it easier to pinpoint and debug issues in code.

To know more about the mocha framework refer to this [documentation by mochajs.org](https://mochajs.org/)
