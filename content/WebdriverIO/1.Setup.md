# Setups and Config
Welcome to the WebDriverIO Setup Documentation! In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the essential steps and best practices for setting up WebDriverIO, a powerful and flexible JavaScript automation framework, to supercharge your web testing efforts.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** should be installed on your computer.
    ::alert{type="info"}
    Note:
    - To install Node.js. Download the Node.js installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download);
    - Once the installer is downloaded. Click on it and install Node.js.
    - After the installation is complete. Verify it by entering the command `node -v` on the terminal. It will display the version of the Node.js installed.
    ::
- **Knowledge of JavaScript**.
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn (npm comes bundled with Node.js)
- **Code Editor**: A code editor like VSCode or PHPStorm.
- **WebDriver-Compatible Browser**: Common choices are Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
 
## Setup WebDriverIO Project

1. Open Code Editor.
2. Create a folder with project name.
3. Open the terminal of that folder. Look for the terminal option on the Code Editor.
4. The path in the terminal window should contain the project folder name. Refer to the image below:
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/project_file.png">
5. Run command: (This creates a node project in that folder that will have a package.json file.)
    ```shell
    npm init -y
    ```
6. Run command: (This will install webdriverIO on the project)
    ```shell
   npm init wdio
   ```
7. When prompted whether to continue or not. Type **Y** and press Enter.
8. When the command is running, choose appropriate options based on your preference. Refer to the image in **Step 16**
9. For "What type of testing would you like to do?". Select **E2E Testing**.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/testing_type.png">
10. For "Which type of environment would you like?". Select **Web**.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/test_env.png">
11. For "With which browser should we start?". Select **chrome**.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/browser.png">
12. Choose **Mocha Framework** for framework.
13. Choose **spec reporter**  for test case reporting.
14. For "Do you want to add plugins to your test setup?". Select **wait-for**.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/plugin.png">
15. For "Do you want to add service to your test setup?". Choose **Appium**.
16. For "What is the base url?". Press **Enter**.
17. When "Do you want me install `npm install`" is prompted. Press **Enter**.
18. Wait for the command `npm install` to complete.
16. After the setup is complete, a success message will be shown. Refer to the image below:
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/appium-setup-ts.png">
18. The setup will install some directories and files on the project.
19. Verify whether the `wdio.conf.js` file are created or not.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/wdio_config_image.png">
20. There should be some sample test cases which were created during the setup. Verify the same in `test/spec/` directory.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/example.png">
::alert{type="warning"}
Note:
    - The points in the Requirement section must be fulfilled before working on the setup.
    - Carefully choose the options during the WebDriverIO setup.
    - Some commands may take longer time to execute which is expected. Just wait for it to complete. 
    - Previous commands must be completed successfully before running the next command.

## Configure ENV Files

Now, before running the test scripts we need to install several packages, configure the `wdio.conf.js` file. We also need to create **env** file so that the capabilities for different platforms can be added.

Follow the steps given below:

1. Run following commands in the terminal of the

1. Create a new file in the root folder of the project. (In VSCode, select wdio.conf.js file. Click on the plus icon on the top).
2. Name the file `wdio.env.js`.
3. 

## Running the test script

1. Before running the test script. We need to verify the path of under the specs keyword in file `wdio.conf.js`.
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/spec_file_path.png">
    ::alert{type="info"}
    Note:
    - In the path "*" symbol indicates that the run command will run all the test cases inside the spec folder.
    - You can replace "*" symbol with a specific test file. Run comand will run only that test file.
    - For run command refer to the steps given below.
    ::
2. To run the test script, run command:
    ```shell
    npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
    ```
3. After the test script ran successfully, a spec report will be generated. Refer to the image below:
    <img src="/images/webdriverio/report.png">
3. To run a specific test script: Run the command:
    ```shell
    npx wdio run wdio.conf.js --spec test1.js
    ```
    ::alert{type="info"}
    Note:
    - In the code above you can change the **test1.js** with your test file name.
    ::
4. Once the sample test scripts are running successfully, you can modify and create your own scripts.

## Mocha Framework
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.
::alert{type="warning"}
If you completed the previous steps and installed the mocha framework during setup then ignore the steps given below. This is only for those who do not add mocha during installation and want to install after setup.
::

First, install the adapter package from NPM:
```shell
npm install @wdio/mocha-framework --save-dev
```

After a successful installation of the mocha framework. Verify the `package.json` file the presence of mocha framework:
> "@wdio/mocha-framework": "^8.16.12"

#### Advantages of Mocha
1. **Feasibility:** Mocha is simple to install and get started with. It can be easily integrated into JavaScript projects, quickly incorporating testing into the development workflow.

2. **Versatility:** Mocha can be used in browser and server-side environments, making it suitable for various JavaScript applications. Mocha can efficiently test code when developing a back-end server or front-end web application.

3. **Accuracy:** Mocha generates detailed and accurate test reports, clearly indicating the success or failure of each test. Mocha provides informative error messages, and stack traces when a test fails, making it easier to pinpoint and debug issues in code.

To know more about the mocha framework refer to this [documentation by mochajs.org](https://mochajs.org/)
