# Setup Existing Project
This documentation outlines the setup procedures for our existing WebDriverIO project. It is designed to serve as a guide for both new team members joining the project and existing contributors seeking a clear reference on the project's setup.

## Project with Appium
In this, we are setting up a "project with appium" on a new system. To run the test scripts, we need to install all the dependencies in the file `package.json` file. We also need to install few more packages before start working on the test scripts.

Follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Clone the repository of the project that has WebdriverIO with appium configured.
2. Open the cloned project in Code Editor.
3. Open the terminal of that folder. Look for the terminal option on the Code Editor.
4. The path in the terminal window should contain the project folder name.
5. Run the follwing command:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```
6. After the command Ran successfully. Update the chrome browser to the latest version.
7. Run the following command to update the appium-chromium-driver
    ```shell
    npm i appium-chromium-driver --save-dev
    ```
8. Now, all the neccessary packages are installed.
9. Before running the test script. We need to verify the path of under the specs keyword in file `wdio.conf.js`.
    ```js
    specs: [
        './test/specs/**/*.js'
    ],
    ```
    ::alert{type="info"}
    Note:
    - In the path "*" symbol indicates that the run command will run all the test files inside the spec folder.
    - You can replace "*" symbol with a specific test file. Run comand will run only that test file.
    - For run command refer to the steps given below.
    ::
10. To run the test script, run command:
    ```shell
    npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
    ```

## Project without Appium

In this, we are setting up a "project that does not have appium". The project will have webdriverio installed in it. We have to add appium service in the project. We also need to add multiple dependencies for appium to work properly.

Follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Clone the repository of the project that has WebdriverIO with appium configured.
2. Open the cloned project in Code Editor.
3. Open the terminal of that folder. Look for the terminal option on the Code Editor.
4. The path in the terminal window should contain the project folder name.
5. Run the follwing command:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```
6. Before working on the configuration, To verify if webdriverio is installed on the project or not, run the command given below:
    ```shell
    npx wdio --version
    ```
    The version of webdriverIO installed on the project should be visible.

### Install Dependencies
In this section we need to install multiple dependencies related to appium. To install those, follow the steps given below:
