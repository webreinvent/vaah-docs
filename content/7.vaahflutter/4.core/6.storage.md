Vaah Flutter allows its users to use storage options without any hassle. You just need to pass a couple of parameters in [environment configuration](../3.essentials/2.environments.md) and the storage service is ready to use.

## Overview

The `Storage` class is an abstract class that provides an interface for [local storage](../5.directory_structure/3.vaahextendflutter/5.services/storage/1.local_storage.md) and [network storage](../5.directory_structure/3.vaahextendflutter/5.services/storage/2.network_storage.md)(not implemented yet) implementations. 

It supports two local storages to select from : Hive and Flutter Secure Storage. Depending on the configuration, it can create an instance of either `HiveStorageImpl` or `FlutterSecureStorageImpl`. If no valid storage type is specified, a `NoOpStorage` implementation is used, in which all methods are empty.

|   `createLocal()`  | (Optional) `name (String)` default is 'default' | An instance of `HiveStorageImpl`, `FlutterSecureStorageImpl`, or `NoOpStorage`. | Creates a new local storage instance based on the environment configuration. |


## Methods

| Name          | Parameters |  Returns    |  Description    |
|    :---       |   :----    |    :----    |     :---        |
| `init()`      | None       | `Future<void>` | Initializes the storage. For `HiveStorageImpl`, it sets up the Hive directory and opens a box. Not required for `FlutterSecureStorageImpl`. |
| `create()`    | `key (String)` & `value (String)` | `Future<void>` | Creates or updates a single key-value pair in the storage. |
| `createAll()` | `values (Map<String, String>)` | `Future<void>` | Creates or updates multiple key-value pairs in the storage. |
| `read()`      | `key (String)` | `Future<String?>` | Reads the value of the item at the specified key from the storage. |
| `readAll()`   | (Optional) `keys (List<String>)` default is empty List  | `Future<Map<String, String?>>` | Reads multiple values from the storage. If no keys are provided, it returns all values. |
| `delete()`    | `key (String)` | `Future<String?>` | Deletes the item at the specified key from the storage. |
| `deleteAll()` | (Optional) `keys (List<String>)` default is empty List | `Future<void>` | Deletes multiple items from the storage. If no keys are provided, it deletes all values. |
