## How to run app in different environments:

| **Environment name** | **Command** |
| --- | --- |
| Default | `flutter run` OR `flutter run --dart-define="environment=default"`  |
| Development | `flutter run --dart-define="environment=develop"` |
| Staging/ QA | `flutter run --dart-define="environment=stage"` |
| Production | `flutter run --dart-define="environment=production"` |

## How to build app?

### Building app with different environments

| **Platform** | **Environment name** | **Command** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Default | `flutter build apk` OR `flutter build apk --dart-define="environment=default"`  |
| Android | Development | `flutter build apk --dart-define="environment=develop"` |
| Android | Staging/ QA | `flutter build apk --dart-define="environment=stage"` |
| Android | Production | `flutter build apk --dart-define="environment=production"` |
| Android (appbundle) | Default | `flutter build appbundle` OR `flutter build appbundle --dart-define="environment=default"`  |
| Android (appbundle) | Development | `flutter build appbundle --dart-define="environment=develop"` |
| Android (appbundle) | Staging/ QA | `flutter build appbundle --dart-define="environment=stage"` |
| Android (appbundle) | Production | `flutter build appbundle --dart-define="environment=production"` |

| **Platform** | **Environment name** | **Command** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | Default | `flutter build ipa` OR `flutter build ipa --dart-define="environment=default"`  |
| iOS | Development | `flutter build ipa --dart-define="environment=develop"` |
| iOS | Staging/ QA | `flutter build ipa --dart-define="environment=stage"` |
| iOS | Production | `flutter build ipa --dart-define="environment=production"` |
| iOS (.app) | Default | `flutter build ios` OR `flutter build ipa --dart-define="environment=default"`  |
| iOS (.app) | Development | `flutter build ios --dart-define="environment=develop"` |
| iOS (.app) | Staging/ QA | `flutter build ios --dart-define="environment=stage"` |
| iOS (.app) | Production | `flutter build ios --dart-define="environment=production"` |

### Building in different modes.

Pass additional arguments with your build commands.

| **mode** | **Command** |
| --- | --- |
| Debug | `flutter build ipa --debug`, `flutter build apk --debug`  |
| Profile | `flutter build ipa --profile`, `flutter build apk --profile`  |
| Release | `flutter build ipa --release`, `flutter build apk --release`  |

### Building ipa without signing it
| **flag** | **command** |
| --- | --- |
| --no-codesign | `flutter build ipa --no-codesign`, `flutter build ios --no-codesign`  |

Note: building for `ipa` will give `Runner.xcarchive`. To check the app, you should right click on `Runner.xcarchive` > then select `show package contents` > then open `products` > `application` > There you will be able to find the application.
