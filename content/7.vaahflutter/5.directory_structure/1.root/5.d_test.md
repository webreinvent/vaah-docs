## What is this directory about

Put all your test files here so that the framework can find them when, for example, the `flutter test` command is executed. Every file also needs a `suffix _test.dart` to be successfully found. Stick to that pattern and youâ€™ll have no problems. 

It is considered good practice when your test folder structure matches your lib folder structure. This will speed up navigation inside the project for developers.
