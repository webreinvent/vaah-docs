Models are data classes that you create according to your needs. And with the help of the controller, you can manipulate the modelâ€™s data.

Place all your models in here like user.dart, product.dart or any other.

Holds the state of the application and provides an API to access/filter/manipulate that data. Its concern is data encapsulation and management. It contains logic to structure, validate or compare different pieces of data that we call Domain Logic.
