## Releases

### Versioning Scheme

VaahNuxt and its other first-party packages follow Semantic Versioning. Major platform releases are released every 6 to 8 months, while minor and patch releases maybe released as often as every month. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.

The official way to report the bugs is via [github repo](https://github.com/webreinvent/vaahflutter/issues).

### Support Policy

Bug fixes are provided for one year and security fixes are provided for two years for all `major` releases. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance.
