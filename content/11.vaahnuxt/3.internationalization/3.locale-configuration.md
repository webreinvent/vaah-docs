## Locales 
The modus operandi behind the I18n module is that we create a translation map for the static strings in our NUXT App.

For instance, if we have a button that reads "Contact Us" in English and we want to serve French users their version of the site, the button should read "Contactez-nous" in french. 

To achieve this, we create translation maps in our app for different languages and regions.

These maps are `JSON` files which contain keys and values as strings that we want to render on the page.

::alert{type="info" class="p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-blue-800 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400" role="alert"}
Assumption:   
- For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that our NUXT client has only one page; i.e. the Home Page and contains only the following items/elements.  

|Element     | Description                                           | 
|------------|---------                                              |
| h1         | The page has one H1 tag for the title in the center that reads "Welcome"   |
| button     | The page has one button tag that reads "Contact us"   |

## Setting Up Locales 

#### Step 1
Create a folder/directory names locales in the root of the project  directory.

Like so:

```
└── 📁localization
    └── .gitignore
    └── 📁.nuxt
    └── app.vue
    └── 📁component
    └── 📁locales  <-- Create this folder/Directory
    └── nuxt.config.ts
    └── package-lock.json
    └── package.json
    └── 📁pages
        └── index.vue
    └── 📁public
    └── README.md
    └── 📁server
    └── tsconfig.json
    └── nuxt.config.ts
```

#### Step 2 
We will now create the translation map based on the locale. 
Our NUXT client will use US English by default but we will provide translation for French users as well. 

This means that our product has to cater to English readers as well as French; which further implies that we will have to create and maintain two translation maps.

One for **English - US** and another for **French - FR**.

Lets create two files in our locales folder
- en-US.json
- fr-FR.json

```
└── 📁localization
    └── .gitignore
    └── 📁.nuxt
    └── app.vue
    └── 📁component
    └── 📁locales
        └── en-US.json  <----|   Create these
        └── fr-FR.json  <----|   two files
    └── nuxt.config.ts
    └── package-lock.json
    └── package.json
    └── 📁pages
        └── index.vue
    └── 📁public
    └── README.md
    └── 📁server
    └── tsconfig.json
    └── nuxt.config.ts
```


Naming convention is important here and this is the standard in which we should name our translation maps. The files names are case sensitive as well; ensure that region is always uppercase and language is always lowercase. 

The convention is as follows:
`'languauge'-'REGION'.json`

This is the ISO 639-1 Standard for Language Codes.

You can find language codes for all regions/languages [here](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/) 


#### Step 3 
We have created the locale files, now we need to add content to these files. 

As decalred in the beginning, our NUXT project contains one page only. This page contains a title and a button. We'll add the copy of these two elements in the translation maps.

Let's add the content in the `en-US.json` file first, considering it'll contain the data for English version which is the default locale of our website. 

```json
{
    "home_page": {
        "title": "Welcome",
        "contact_us_button": "Contact Us"
    }
}
```

Copy the above code and add it to your `en-US.json` file.

Notice the JSON structure; we have created an object `home_page`. This will contain all our translation maps that exist on the homepage. 

For different pages, you should create separate objects and for different sections within the same page, create objects inside an object.

For instance:
```json
{
    "home_page": {
        "title": "Welcome",
        "contact_us_button": "Contact Us",
        "hero_section": {
            "hero_title": "This is the Hero Section",
            "hero_subtitle": "This is the Hero Section Subtitle"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 4
Once you've created your en-US.json file; translate the strings to the desired language, in our case it is French. 
You can use any translator that you are confortable with; ChatGPT and Google Translate do a good job in this regard. 

This is what the translated JSON will look like: 

```json
{
    "home_page": {
        "title": "Bienvenue",
        "contact_us_button": "Nous contacter"
    }
}
```

Add the above contents to your `fr-FR.json` file.

### Conclusion
We've successfully created maps for English version and French version of our NUXT product. 
Now we need to configure the I18n Module in our NUXT config in the next step and use these map values in our code base.
