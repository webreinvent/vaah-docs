title: I18n Setup with Nuxt
---

## Setup
To get started with I18n, add the `@nuxt/I18n` module to your project with the following command: 

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add i18n
```

Now, head to your `nuxt.config.ts` to check whether the I18n module has been added or not. 
The above command automatically adds the config details to your `nuxt.config.ts`. 

You should see the following module added to your config: 

```bash
{
  modules: [
    '@nuxtjs/i18n', <---This module
  ],
}
```

## Configuring I18n

There are two ways in which we can configure I18n in our product; both of them are fine and accepted as per NUXT documentation. 

#### First Method
The default mathod is by configuring an `i18n` object inside the `nuxt.config.ts`. 
We recommend the first method because it keeps the code clean and understandable. 

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/i18n'],
  i18n: {
    // Separate I18n Object
  }
})
```

#### Second Method
Alternatively, we can pass the configuration options, when we declare the I18n Module.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    [
      '@nuxtjs/i18n',
      {
        // Module Options
      }
    ]
  ]
})
```

Before configuring I18n in/for our project there is one step that we have to cover, setting up "locales" for our project. 

This is disccussed in the next section.
