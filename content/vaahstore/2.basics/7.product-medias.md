### Update Form Features

all the feature of update form below.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-medias/edit-options.png">



###  1. Save And Close

The `save and close` functionality in product media operations allows users to save changes 
made in the updated form and simultaneously close it. This process is akin to the `create and close` operation for generating new product media. Whether creating or updating, this feature 
provides specific functionalities, offering similar features during updates as those available 
in the creation of new product media.

###  2. Save And Clone


Similar to `save and close`, the `save and clone` functionality is employed to preserve all existing
details and data of a specific record in a new form except image . This design is particularly useful when certain
records share identical fields with only minor differences. Instead of recreating these records and
manually inputting all the fields, which can be time-consuming, `Vaahstore` helps you save a significant
amount of time through the `save-and-clone` functionality. This feature is available in both the
creation and update forms, and you can refer to the image below for guidance.

<img src="/images/vaahstore/product-medias/after-save-and-clone.png">

Here after `save and clone` option, new create form is opened with certain records as shown in above image.

###  3. Save And New

Vaahstore's new feature, `Save and New`, streamlines data management by allowing users to 
preserve existing data while simultaneously opening a new form. Unlike traditional methods 
that involve closing the update form and opening a create form separately, `Save and New`
combines these steps into one efficient click. This innovative functionality optimizes time 
utilization, providing a seamless and time-saving experience for users updating and creating 
records.

Below image shows after click on `Save and New` option.

###  4. Trash , Delete And Fill

In our updated form, we've introduced key functionalities to enhance user experience. 
The `Trash` option enables the temporary removal of records, allowing for easy restoration. 
In contrast, `Delete` permanently erases records with no recovery option. The `Fill` feature 
efficiently populates all fields with dummy data, streamlining the data entry process.

Here is the `Reset` functionality, visible in the image below, which is used  Reset of 
field during the creation of a Product Medias.
clearing all fields in a
single click rather than the manual removal of individual entries. These functionalities
collectively enrich the user interface, providing flexibility and efficiency in data management.
