- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Customer`.
- Clone `Customer` details.
- Autofill `Customer` fields.
- Sort the `Customer` list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Customer`.
- List All existing `Customer`.
- Filter the `Customer` list by searching using different `fields`.
- Filter the `Customer` list by different status, including trashed `Customer`.
- Delete an existing `Customer`.
- Delete or temporarily trash an already existing `Customer`.


## Overview Of Customer Crud

First time when  you interact with `Customer` in `VaahStore`, it will appear like this: at the top,
you'll find  `Customer ` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new Customer,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.
And a left-side you can access all other crud like store, Customer etc.
