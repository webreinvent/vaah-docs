## Overview Of Customer Crud

First time when  you interact with `Customer` in `VaahStore`, it will appear like this: at the top,
you'll find  `Customer ` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new Customer,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.

## Customer Table

The Customer Table contains all the customers registered in VaahStore. Using this table, you can
search for any customer in the list using the search filter. The table also provides you with the option
to view and update the details of the customer,exclusively accessible to those with the necessary permissions and roles.

## Understanding Customer Table 

In the Customer Table, you'll find essential details about customers such as their first name,
last name, and email. The table features an eye-shaped "View" button that allows you to access
comprehensive customer information, including details about the user who created the customer entry,
update history, name, email, and more.

Adjacent to the View button is a pencil-shaped "Update" button. This button enables authorized users,
those with the necessary permissions, to modify customer details.

Lastly, there's a "Trash" button. This button serves a dual purpose: it allows users to remove a 
record from the visible list without permanently deleting it. Instead, it initiates a soft delete,
sending the record to a designated trash area. You can retrieve these records at any time by
applying the trash filter, providing a safety net for data recovery when needed.

## Understanding Customer Create Form


The Customer Creation Form is designed to capture essential customer details,
and users are required to fill in specific fields to initiate the creation of a new customer
record. Mandatory fields include first name, last name, email, etc.

### Key features of the Create Form

### Dropdown Menu Options
When you click on the down-arrow button, a menu with various options appears. These options serve
different purposes:

### 1.Create and Close 

Initiates the creation of a new customer record and closes the form upon submission.

### 2.Create and New 
Creates a new customer entry and keeps the form open for immediate subsequent entries.

### 3.Create and Clone 

Useful for creating entries for customers who share similar details. The form 
autofills with the details of the previously created customer, allowing for efficient data
entry with minor adjustments.
### 4.Fill and Reset 
Fills all the form fields with dummy data, facilitating testing or demonstration purposes.
These functionalities enhance user flexibility and efficiency when creating and managing customer
records through the form.


## Understanding the Customer Update Form

Our Customer Update Form is a handy tool for managing customer information. You can use it when 
creating new records or updating existing ones. To update a record, just click the pencil button,
and the update form will pop up with all the details of that customer. Keep in mind that only users
with the right permissions can make these updates.

### Key Features of the Update Form

### Dropdown Menu Options

Clicking the down-arrow button shows a menu with different choices:

### 1. Save and Close
This option lets you update customer details and close the update form in one go.

### 2. Save and New
Use this option to save the updated customer details and start creating a new form at the same time.

### 3. Save and Clone
This feature is handy when updating info for customers with similar details. The form fills 
in with the details of a previously created customer, making it easy to make small changes.

### 4.Trash
When you trash a record, it's like a soft delete. The record won't show up in the regular
list, but if you use filters and include 'trash,' you can see records with this tag.

### 5.Delete
You can also delete records using the update form bulk menu, which is helpful when you want
to remove multiple records at once.
