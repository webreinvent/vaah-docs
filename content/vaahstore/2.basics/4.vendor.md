# Vendor Crud

## Purpose

A vendor is a person, company, or entity that sells goods or services. In the context of business
and commerce, a vendor is often someone who supplies products or services to customers, either 
directly or through a distribution channel. Vendors can operate in various industries, providing
a wide range of goods and services.

## Understand Vendor

Imagine you're organizing a big party. You need decorations, food, and drinks.
Now, think of vendors as the different people or businesses you'd buy these things from.

### Supplier (or Seller): 
This is like the person selling balloons, streamers, and other party decorations. 
They're providing the materials you need.

### Manufacturer: 
Picture someone making custom-made cakes for your party. They take the ingredients 
(supplied by others) and create the final product.

### End-User:
That's you, the person throwing the party, using the products and services provided by 
vendors to make your event a success.
