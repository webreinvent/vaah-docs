# Wishlist Crud

## Purpose

A wishlist is a feature often found on e-commerce websites or apps. It allows users to create a 
personalized list of products they are interested in but may not be ready to purchase immediately. 
The wishlist serves as a kind of bookmark or reminder for users to revisit and consider these items
for future buying decisions. It's a user-friendly tool that enhances the shopping experience by helping
individuals keep track of products they find appealing.

## Understand Wishlist

### Real-Life Wishlist:

You grab a piece of paper or use a note-taking app on your phone.
You write down the title of the book, the author, and maybe a brief note about why it caught your interest.

### Importance of the Wishlist:

The wishlist serves as a reminder of books you want to read in the future.
When you finish your current book, you can refer to your wishlist to remember the titles and authors of books you found interesting.

### Benefits:
The wishlist helps you stay organized and prevents you from forgetting about books you'd like to explore.
It makes your next visit to the bookstore more focused, as you already have a list of books you are excited about.
