# Product Variation Crud 

## Purpose


Product variation refers to the range of options, versions, or variations that a specific product 
can have within a product line. It involves offering customers different choices in terms of features,
specifications, designs, sizes, colors, or other attributes. The goal of introducing product variation is
to cater to the diverse preferences, needs, and requirements of consumers, ultimately enhancing customer 
satisfaction and expanding the market reach of the product.

## Features & Demos

The `Product variation` CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality offers a wide range of features,
including the ability to display all Product Variation. Furthermore, it provides bulk actions that allow you 
to delete multiple pieces of Product Variation with a single click and update Product Variation, offering the following features:

- Create a New `Product Variation`
- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Product Variation`.
- Clone `Product Variation` details.
- Autofill `Product Variation` fields.
- Sort the `Product Variation` list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Product Variation`.
- List All existing `Product Variation`.
- Filter the `Product Variation` list by searching using different `fields`.
- Filter the `Product Variation` list by different status, including trashed `Product Variation`.
- Delete an existing `Product Variation`.
- Delete or temporarily trash an already existing `Product Variation`.


## Overview Of Product Variation Crud

First time when  you interact with `Product Variation CRUD` in `VaahStore`, it will appear like this: at the top,
you'll find  `Product Variation ` name, along with options such as a `Create` button for adding new product variation,
a `Reload` button for retrieving the entire list of data, and a `dropdown button` for creating multiple entries with a single click.
And a left-side you can access all other crud like store, vendor etc.

At the bottom, you'll find two toggle menus, each offering distinct features.
The first menu allows you to perform specific actions on individual data entries, such as `activation`, `deactivation`, `deletion`, and `trashing`.

The other menu provides `bulk actions`, enabling you to perform actions on multiple data entries at once, such as deleting all data or activating all data. Additionally, in the right corner,
there is a search bar that allows you to search for specific data in the list. Further options include a filter button and a filter reset button for data filtering.

At the bottom, you'll find a table with column names, and there's also a pagination section.
You have the option to customize the pagination according to your preference.
By default, it displays 20 data entries per page, but you can adjust this setting to determine how many data entries you want to see on a single page.
It's entirely up to you.
