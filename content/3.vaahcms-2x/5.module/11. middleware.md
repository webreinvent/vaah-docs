title: Middleware

## Introduction
Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests entering your application.
It is very essential for the security of the application.
For example. You want your users to see the particular page of website only if user is authenticated.
Then with the help of middleware you can check that particular user is authenticated or not, if the user is not authenticated then 
middleware will redirect the user to your application's login screen. However, if the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application.

```
