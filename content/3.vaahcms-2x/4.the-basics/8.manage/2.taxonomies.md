title: Taxonomies
---


## Purpose

Although taxonomies are a crucial component of categorising the material on your application, the phrase frequently confuses 
newcomers because `Taxonomy` isn't a term that most of us use on a daily basis. Taxonomy are really 
just a technique to group similar posts entries (or other types of content) together. 
That's it! It's a large term, but it's not as hard to understand as it would seem.






## Why We Use  Taxonomies 

In `VaahCMS`, taxonomies serve several important purposes and are used for specific reasons:


### Real Life Example
Imagine you're developing an `e-commerce` website where you sell a wide range of products.
Each product has numerous details, including product `origin`, `material`, `expiry date`, `price`,and more. 
Additionally, you want to categorize your products into different groups, such as `For Adults`, `For Children`, and `For Women`.

### Using Taxonomies for Categories

### Product Details 
When it comes to product details, you have a wealth of information to manage. This includes product
`names`, `descriptions`, `images`, `pricing`, `inventory`, and more. Creating a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
for each of these product details can be complex and overwhelming.

### Categories 
On the other hand, product categories are relatively straightforward. They typically involve a name and
a brief description. Instead of creating a full CRUD for categories, you can use taxonomies to define 
and manage these categories efficiently.


## How Taxonomies Work

### Taxonomy Type:
You create a `Categories` taxonomy type specifically for categorizing products. This taxonomy type 
consists of basic attributes like `Name` and `Description`.

### Category Entries: 

Within the `Categories` taxonomy, you add entries for different categories such as `For Adults`,
`For Children`, and `For Women`. Each entry represents a product category.

### Associating Categories with Products:

In your product CRUD, you include a field for `Category`. Instead of manually entering category names for each product, 
you link them to the corresponding category entry within the `Categories` taxonomy. This association can be done through a simple dropdown or selection process.


## When Not to Use Taxonomies

Certainly, here are a few scenarios where it might not be necessary to use taxonomies in `VaahCMS`:

### 1. When You Need Extensive Data Associations: 

If you want to associate a significant amount of data with another dataset, such as detailed information
like movie name, actors' names, release year, genre, duration, and poster, it's often more suitable to 
create a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for that data. For instance, if you want to manage 
comprehensive movie details, creating a dedicated CRUD for movies would be more appropriate than using
taxonomies.

### 2. Complex Data Structures:

Taxonomies are ideal for organizing simple data structures or limited sets of information. If your data 
requires complex relationships, hierarchies, or multiple attributes, creating a CRUD with custom fields
and relationships may be a better choice.

### 3. Extensive Customization Needs:

When you require extensive customization and control over the data presentation, storage, and retrieval,
a CRUD provides greater flexibility. Taxonomies are more suitable for straightforward categorization 
and tagging.

### 4. Data Validation and Integrity:

If you need to enforce strict data validation and integrity checks, especially when dealing with various 
data types, CRUDs offer more robust validation mechanisms and control over data input.

In contrast, taxonomies are best used when you have relatively simple data that needs categorization
or tagging. For example, if you only need to associate movie directors' names with movies, creating a 
taxonomy type for directors and linking them to movies in a CRUD is an efficient approach. This is 
especially valuable when you require minimal data, like just the director's name, and don't need 
extensive fields or complex relationships.


### Conclusion

`Taxonomies` are a valuable feature within `VaahCMS` that provide a structured and organized approach to managing and categorizing data.
They offer flexibility in classifying various types of content, making it easier to navigate, search, and retrieve information.
Taxonomies contribute to improved data organization, effective content management, and streamlined user experiences.
Whether you're building a website, application, or custom CRUD module, `VaahCMS's` taxonomy system empowers you to create
`hierarchical classifications`, manage data relationships, and enhance the overall efficiency of your content management processes.
By utilizing taxonomies wisely, you can optimize data storage, retrieval, and presentation, ultimately contributing to a more user-friendly and well-structured digital ecosystem.



## Default Taxonomy Types

By default, `VaahCMS` have following types of `Taxonomies`:

1. Countries
2. Registrations

## Features & Demos
 
### Create Taxonomy and Taxonomy Types via VaahSeeder

Through seeds, you can create `Taxonomy` and `Taxonomy types`.
Make two json files with the names `taxonomy.json` and `taxonomy_types.json` in the directory `../VaahCms/Modules/<module-name>/Database/Seeds/json/`.

::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE:   
You need to make a directory named as `json` under `../VaahCms/Modules/<module-name>/Database/Seeds`.
::
`taxonomy.json`

```json
[

    {
        "type_slug": "roles",
        "name": "Backend"
    },
    {
        "type_slug": "roles",
        "name": "Frontend"
    },
    {
        "type_slug": "registrations",
        "name": "Email Verification Pending"
    }
]
```

`taxonomy_types.json`

```json
[

    {
        "name": "Countries"
    },

    {
        "name": "Cities",
        "parent_slug": "countries"
    },

    {
        "name": "Roles"
    }
]
```
In order to run these seeds you need to add these lines in `run()` method of `DatabaseTableSeeder.php` file
```json 
VaahSeeder::taxonomyTypes(__DIR__.'/json/taxonomy_types.json');
VaahSeeder::taxonomies(__DIR__.'/json/taxonomy.json');
```
`DatabaseTableSeeder.php`

```php
<?php
namespace VaahCms\Modules\{module_name}\Database\Seeds;


use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Libraries\VaahSeeder;

class DatabaseTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        VaahSeeder::taxonomyTypes(__DIR__.'/json/taxonomy_types.json');
        VaahSeeder::taxonomies(__DIR__.'/json/taxonomy.json');
    }

}
```
Now you need to login to the `backend` and `activate` your module again by first `deactivating` it.

### Create Taxonomy via Dashboard

To view the `Taxonomies` section, go to the following url:

```http request
<project-url>/backend#/vaah/manage/taxonomies/
```
Follow below image for reference:
<img src="/images/taxonomies-2.png">
<img src="/images/taxonomies-1.png">

You can create a new `taxonomy` by clicking on `Create` button.
<img src="/images/taxonomies-3.png">
When you click on `Create` button you will see a form with following fields.
<img src="/images/taxonomies-4.png">
Type is the first field, and the options are organised hierarchically. You can manage the taxonomy types also by clicking on the `Manage` button.
The `Tree View` of Taxonomy Types PopUp with 'CRUD' Operation will now show.

You will notice a new field called `Select a Parent` name with the taxonomies of the parent of the type you have chosen if you choose any of the children types.

Complete every field and press the `Create & New` button. A new taxonomy will be added to the list of taxonomies.

You can view the video attached below for more info:

### Create Taxonomy Type via Dashboard
To create a new `Taxonomy Type` you need to click on `Manage` button.

Follow below image for reference:
<img src="/images/taxonomies-5.png">

When you click on `manage` button a PopUp will open with the following fields.
<img src="/images/taxonomies-6.png">

Here in the `Select a Parent` dropdown you need to select a parent for the new `taxonomy type` that we are going to create.
You also need to provide the name of the `taxonomy type`.

Once you filled these details you need to click on `Add` button. A new taxonomy type will be showm to you in the same page.

## Methods

Some reusable method of `Taxonomy` and `TaxonomyType` mentioned bellowed:

#### TaxonomyType::getTaxonomyByType($type)

You can use this method to retrieve all taxonomies that are currently active under given `TaxonomyType` by just giving the desired `TaxonomyType` slug.

```php
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Models\Taxonomy;  // Import Taxonomy class at the top

$taxonomy_type_slug = 'cities';
return $active_taxonomies = Taxonomy::getTaxonomyByType($taxonomy_type_slug);
```
