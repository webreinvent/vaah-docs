## Overview of Site-Setting



### 1.Frontend Welcome Page

In the frontend of your website, there are various elements like the site title, headings, and other 
content that visitors see. These elements are what create the user experience.


### 2.Accessing the Backend

Now, when you switch to the backend of your website, you'll find an icon, often represented as a home 
icon. Clicking on this icon takes you directly to the default frontend page. It's a handy shortcut to quickly view 
your website as visitors do.

The Frontend Page Will  Look like this 

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-2.png"> 



### 3.Changing Site Title and Content

When it comes to making changes to elements like the site title or other content displayed on your 
website, you typically have two options. The first is to manually edit the code responsible for these
elements. For instance, you could navigate to the themes section of your website, specifically the 
resource views, and locate the `default.blade.php` file. In this file, you can modify the title name.

### 4. Using the Backend: 
However, the manual method can be time-consuming and requires technical knowledge. An alternative
and much more convenient approach is to use the backend of your website. The backend provides a
user-friendly interface for changing settings like the site title, copyright text, and more.
It simplifies the process and doesn't require you to delve into the code.




## Purpose of Copy Button

The `Copy Button` is used to provide  quick way to copy the code for specific settings, 
such as the site title or copyright text, from the backend configuration to their frontend pages.
This simplifies the process of ensuring that changes made in the backend are reflected in the frontend 
without users needing to manually update these values. It essentially automates the synchronization of
dynamic content like titles, copyright text, and other settings, enhancing user convenience and ensuring
consistency in the displayed content across the website.

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-3.png"> 


### 1. Adding Copyright Text in the Backend 

In  backend, you have the option to customize various settings, including the copyright 
text. Let's say you want to update the copyright text to display on your homepage.

### 2. Accessing the Copyright Text 

Navigate to the backend settings where you can edit the copyright text. Once you're there, 
you'll find a field for the copyright click on the custom and then appear a text input. You can make your desired changes in this field.

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-4.png"> 

### 3. Using the Copy Button:
Next to the copyright text input field, there's a handy "Copy" button. When you click on this button, 
it copies the code associated with the copyright text.

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-5.png"> 

### 4. Adding Copyright Text to the Homepage
Now, go to the page where you want to display the copyright text, which is typically your homepage. 
Instead of manually entering the copyright text, you can paste the copied code directly onto your homepage file .
we are showing the copyright text into homepage you can show where you want Go to Themes->Resource->Views->frontend->pages->home.blade.php  file .

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-6.png"> 

### 5. Saving the Setting
Once you've pasted the code on your homepage, you can save the changes. This ensures that the copyright
text is now dynamically linked to the setting you updated in the backend.

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-7.png"> 

Now Your Welcome Page look like this in the image you can see the copyright text

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-8.png"> 


### 6. Future Copyright Text Changes

Suppose you need to update the copyright text in the future. Instead of manually editing the text on 
your homepage again, you can simply return to the backend settings.

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-9.png"> 



### 7. Updating Copyright Text
In the backend settings, make the desired changes to the copyright text. After you've made your
adjustments, click on the "Save Setting" button to save the updated copyright text.

<img src="/images/general-site-setting-7.png"> 

### 8. Automatic Update on Homepage
Here's the magic: When you save the setting in the backend, it automatically reflects those changes
wherever you've placed the copyright text code on your homepage. You don't need to manually edit 
the homepage code each time you update the copyright text.

## How to create Setting

You can create a Setting through `Seeds` and add a field on Setting Form for that Setting.

Create a json file of name `settings.json` at `<module>/Database/Seeds/json/` this directory.

Write this code in `settings.json` file.

```json
[

    {
        "category": "global",
        "key": "site_title",
        "value": "VaahCMS"
    },
    {
        "category": "global",
        "key": "site_description",
        "value": "Another awesome site on VaahCMS"
    }

]
```

You have to create `seedSetting()` method in `DatabaseTableSeeder.php` file.To run this seed, And you have to `Deactivate` and `Activate` you `Module` 

```php
 function seeds()
    {
     $this->seedSettings();
    }

public function getListFromJson($json_file_name)
    {
        $json_file = __DIR__."/json/".$json_file_name;
        $jsonString = file_get_contents($json_file);
        return json_decode($jsonString, true);
    }

public function seedSettings()
    {


        $list = $this->getListFromJson("settings.json");

        foreach($list as $item)
        {
            $exist = \DB::table( 'vh_settings' )
                ->where( 'category', $item['category'] )
                ->where( 'key', $item['key'] )
                ->first();

            if (!$exist){

                if(isset($item['type']) && $item['type']=='json')
                {
                    $item['value']=json_encode($item['value']);
                }

                \DB::table( 'vh_settings' )->insert( $item );
            } else{
                \DB::table( 'vh_settings' )
                    ->where( 'category', $item['category'] )
                    ->where( 'key', $item['key'] )
                    ->update($item);
            }
        }

    }
```
