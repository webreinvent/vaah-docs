title: Batches
---


## Introduction

Through this feature you can monitor the assign jobs. This job section will show you the records of completed jobs only.
In this section we can see progress of the Batches of jobs like if batch have failed or batch has completed executing or when has this batch completed or what percentage of the batch has completed etc

Visit following url you will see the Batches section:

```http request
<public-url>/backend#/vaah/advanced/batches
```

Below is an example of Batch records.

### Step-1 Create Batch Table

- Jobs can be batched in order to be executed in bulk.
- `queue:batches-table` helps you to create migration file for batching.

```shell
php artisan queue:batches-table 
```

```create table in database```
```shell
php artisan migrate 
```

Batch table will contain meta information about your job batches, such as their completion percentage.

### Step-2 Create Batch Class
To make a Job Batchable use
```php  
use Illuminate\Bus\Batchable;
```
Imports the job class.

```php
<?php
 
namespace App\Jobs;
 
use Illuminate\Bus\Batchable;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
 
class ImportCsv implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Batchable, Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;
 
    /**
     * Execute the job.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        if ($this->batch()->cancelled()) {
            // Determine if the batch has been cancelled...
 
            return;
        }
 
        // Import a portion of the CSV file...
    }
}
```
### Step-3 Create a Batch of Jobs

- Include `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;` to use `batch()` function. 
- Call your jobs in side the `batch()` function. And these jobs will add into batches.

```php
$batch = Bus::batch([
    new MatchSendEmail(),
    new MatchSendEmail(),
    new MatchSendEmail(),
])->then(function (Batch $batch) {
    // All jobs completed successfully...
})->catch(function (Batch $batch, Throwable $e) {
    // First batch job failure detected...
})->finally(function (Batch $batch) {
    // The batch has finished executing...
})->dispatch();
 
return $batch->id;
```

Visit following url to see the added batches in table

`<public-url>/backend#/vaah/advanced/batches`
::alert{type="info"}
Note   
This section contains information related to batches that has been executed. Like percentage of completion, ids of failed jobs, completion date or cancellation date etc. 
::
### Step-4 Run batches
- Batches are group of jobs for run batches you need to run jobs.

#### Run jobs
```php
php artisan queue:work
```
or
```php
php artisan queue:work --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=env_filename
```
::alert{type="info"}
Note   
If you make any changes in code of your Job class, then you must restart the `queue:work` command.
::

If you want to run without cache use following command:
```php
php artisan queue:listen --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=env_filename
```
```php
php artisan queue:listen --queue=high,medium,low,default --env=develop
```
