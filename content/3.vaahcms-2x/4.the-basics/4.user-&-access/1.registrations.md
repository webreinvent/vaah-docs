title: Registrations
---
 

## Purpose
Suppose there are 10,000 users who have registered in VaahCMS and there might be the possibility that
only few of them will be the verified users.
The main purpose of Registrations method  is to prevent `users` tables from being filled with unnecessary   front-end registrations. 
Using this method we identify the actual user before saving their details into `users` table. Once the user is verified then their details will be saved in the `users` table in the database.

## Features & Demos

The `Registration` page will display all registered `Registration` provide a form for creating and updating `Registration`, offering the following features:

- Create a New Registration
- Edit/Update the details of an already existing `Registration`.
- Clone `Registration` details.
- Autofill `Registration` fields.
- Sort the `Registration` list in ascending/descending order.
- Perform Bulk Actions to change the status, trash, or delete `Registration`.
- List All existing `Registration`.
- Filter the `Registration` list by searching using different `fields`.
- Filter the `Registration` list by different status, including trashed `Registration`.
- Delete an existing `Registration`.
- Delete or temporarily trash an already existing `Registration`.




## Create a Registration
In VaahCMS there are two methods of creating a registration
1. From Registrations (Backend)
2. From Frontend   

Follow below image for reference:

<img src="/images/registrations-new-1.png">
You will get to know about both these methods one by one.

##### Method 1 : From Registrations

There are two methods to create a registration , Below  we will discuss How to create a registration from `Registrations(Backend)`.


We will discuss both these methods one by one.

###### 1. From Backend
 To create a new registration from this method, click on `Registrations` icon button  in the side bar.

Follow below image for reference:
<img src="/images/registrations-new-11.png">

You will be able to see the list of registered users along with `create` button. You just need to click on the `Create` button in the top right corner. When you click on `Create` button you should be able to see a `registration` form.    
Follow below image for reference:
<img src="/images/registrations-new-6.png">

::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
You need to make sure status column of that registration is selected as `Email Verification Pending`
we will discuss all three status action Here [Click Here](#status-action-email-verification-pending)
::
Once all the details are filled out by those who have permission to create registrations, clicking the 'Create & New' button will result in the creation of a new registration, with all the details saved in the 'vh_registrations' table

::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
Since the `Registration` is not verified one so their details will not be added in `Users`(vh_users) table.
::


::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
"Here, we will discuss how you can change the status of a registration to make it verified. [Click here](#how-to-update-registration-status-to-verified)
Suppose the registration originates from the frontend, and if a registration has not yet verified their email, we can use this method to verify the registration. 
If the registration is not yet verified, their details will not be added to the Users`(vh_users)` table".

##### Method 2 : From Frontend
In this method a user fills the `Registration` form from following url:   
```
<project-url>/signup/
```
Follow below image for reference:
<img src="/images/registrations-new-4.png">

Once all the required details are filled out by the user and they click on the Sign Up button, an email verification link will be sent to the user, and the details will be saved in the registrations(vh_registration) table.Follow below image for reference:
<img src="/images/registrations-new-7.png">

Users need to click on the `Activate` button link to activate their account.
Once their account has been activated, their details will be created in the `vh_users` table, and they will be redirected to the `login page`.

###  How to Update Registration Status to Verified

### Purpose of this Feature

The primary objective of storing user details in two different tables, namely `vh_registrations` and `vh_users`,
serves to enhance the clarity and distinction between actual users and dummy users. This approach becomes particularly valuable in situations where a large number of `users`,
Suppose there are 10,000 users who have registered in VaahCMS and there might be the possibility that
only few of them will be the verified users.

The `Registrations` method plays a pivotal role in preventing the `users` table from becoming cluttered with unnecessary  registrations.
By employing this method, we establish a process to discern the genuine users from the rest before committing their details to the `users` table within the database.
This helps maintain the integrity and accuracy of the `users` table by ensuring that only verified users' information is included, enhancing overall database efficiency and user management.

Additionally, within this context, we are implementing a mechanism to change the `status` of `registered users` and elevate them to `verified user` status, further ensuring that only legitimate users are granted access to the system or services.
As part of this strategy, we smoothly move user data from 'vh_registration' to 'vh_users,' turning registered users into verified ones."

In VaahCMS there are two methods of Verifying a registration
1. From Registrations
2. From Frontend

### Method 1 : From Registrations

To make a `registered user` a `verified user`, click the `View` button in the list of `registered users`, as shown in the image below:

<img src="/images/register-user-view.png"> 


After clicking on the `View` button, the details of the `registered user` will appear.
Go to the `Status` column and click on the status button, then choose "Email Verified," as demonstrated in the image below:

<img src="/images/register-user-change-status-option.png"> 

You can also send the email verification link to the registered user.
Creat User   will appear in green color with a dropdown button that allows you to click on it and send a welcome email.
The details of the registered user will be stored in the users (vh_users) table, demonstrated in the image below:

<img src="/images/register-user-change-status.png"> 

The welcome email is designed to provide a warm and inviting introduction to our platform or service.
It typically includes a friendly greeting, expresses appreciation for the user's registration.

<img src="/images/register-user-welcome-mail.png"> 

### Method 2 : From Frontend

The second method, which you can access by [click here](#method-2-from-frontend), essentially provides a reference for how registrations are initially created from the frontend.
However, the crucial transition occurs when a user verifies their email by clicking on the activation link.
At this point, the system proceeds to store the registration details into the 'vh_users' table. 
In essence, this method illustrates the progression from a preliminary registration to the full integration of the user's data into the 'vh_users' database, ensuring a seamless user experience.

  <img src="/images/vaahcms-two/user_access/bulk.png">


### Status Action Email Verification Pending
- When creating a new `Registration` and filling in all the necessary information, but forgetting to specify the `status` or empty the `status` field, the system will automatically set the status to 'Email Verification Pending' as a default value.
- The main reason it automatically defaults to `Email Verification Pending` is to ensure that regardless of whether the registration is created from the backend or frontend, 
the email associated with the registration must be verified. This differentiation helps distinguish genuine users from dummy users 
  <img src="/images/registrations-new-2.png">


### Status Action Email Verified
- Once the registration is created and the email field is filled during the registration process, 
an email is sent to the user containing a verification link. When the user clicks on the activation link, it confirms the email's verification, and the status in the registration changes to 'Email Verified

- The following image serves as a visual reference to illustrate how a verification email appears in practice. 
It provides a visual representation of what users can expect when they receive a verification email
  <img src="/images/registrations-new-7.png">

::alert{type="warning"}
NOTE   
When a user clicks on the 'Activate' button, it triggers a change in the registration status, which is updated to 'Email Verified.' This signifies that the registration's email has been successfully verified through the activation process.

## Permission

Permissions allow users to access certain features of a course or project site, depending on their roles, and on the decisions made by the site owner and the system administrator. The ability to do actions on your site (including viewing content, editing content, and changing configuration) is governed by permissions. Each permission has a name (such as View published content) and covers one action or a small subset of actions.
