### Step 4: Directory Structure

- Config:
  Config file is present here. Config file contains all the information related to theme, that was provided while creating theme, such as, name, description, `is_migratable`, `is sample data available` etc.
  And this information can be changed in this config file.

- Database:
  All the Factory, Migrations and Seeds files of this theme are present in Database Folder.
    - To generate Migration File,run the following commands:
      ```terminal
       npx vaah cms:t-make migration <theme-folder-name> <migration-name> 
      ```
      for example:
      ```terminal
       npx vaah cms:t-make migration MyTheme contact
      ```
      After running the command,migration file will be generated under `Database/Migrations`.
        <img src="/images/themes/migration-file.png" alt="theme-migration-file"> 
      
    
- To generate Seeds File run the below commands:
  ```terminal
   npx vaah cms:t-make seed <theme-folder-name> <seeder-name>
  ```

  Seeds file will be generated under `Database/Seeders` or we can use json files to seed data into tables.
  To use a json file, create a json file under `<theme-folder>/Database/Seeds/json` folder. 
  example:

  <img src="/images/themes/json-seed-file.png" alt="theme-json-seed-file">

  This json file can be used in SampleDataTableSeeder.
  <img src="/images/themes/seed-file1.png" alt="theme-sample-seeder-file1">

  To run `SampleDataTableSeeder` file, click on `import sample data` button:
  <img src="/images/user-auth-sample.png" alt="theme-sample-seeder-button">
