method of DatabaseTableSeeder.

The `run` method of `DatabaseTableSeeder` is called whenever any module or theme is activated by the user
and it seeds the database with the data.

### 2. SampleDataTableSeeder :

SampleDataTableSeeder is used to seed `test` data into the `database` for the module or the theme. Whenever we want to insert
test data into the `database` we can use `run` method of this `Seeder` class to seed the test data.
To use `SampleDataTableSeeder` we need to click on `import sample data` for the particular module or the theme.   
Follow below image for reference:

Once we click on this `Import Sample Data` button `run` method of `SampleDataTableSeeder` is called
and data is seeded into the database.
