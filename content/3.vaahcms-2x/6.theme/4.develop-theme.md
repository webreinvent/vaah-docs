##### Introduction

This tutorial will help you to develop theme in VaahCMS.



##### Step 1: Install VaahCMS

Steps to install VaahCMS is available at [click here for VaahCMS installation](/vaahcms-2/getting-started/installation)



##### Step 2: Install VaahCLI

Install NodeJs package `VaahCLI` globally, instructions are available at [VaahCLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vaah).

```shell
npm i vaah -g
```



VaahCLI will help you to quickly generate `Module` & `Theme` scaffolding.

You can effectively use the tool with `Command Generator` at [Generators](/vaahcms-2/generators).



##### Step 3: Generate Theme

::alert{type="warning" class="flex items-center p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-yellow-800 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-300 dark:border-yellow-800" role="alert"}
NOTE:
Let's call the theme as `MyTheme`. Open the command line tool & navigate to the project root folder or in PHPStorm open `Terminal` and to generate scaffolding for the theme, use following command:
::
To generate `THEME`, use the following command.
```shell
npx vaah cms:theme
```

After running this command, it will ask you following questions, answers also mentioned in `highlighted` text here:

- Name of The Theme you want to create. For example MyTheme.
```
Enter your theme name:  MyTheme
```
- Title of the Theme. For example Theme for myself.
```
Enter meaningful title for your theme:  Theme for myself
```

- Detailed Description about the Theme.
```
Enter your theme description:  This theme will be used for testing purpose only
```
- Name of the person creating the Theme or press enter to go with default value provided.
```
Enter Author name:  vaah
```
- Email of the author or press enter to go with default value.
```
Enter Author email:  support@vaah.dev
```
- Author website and download url or Press Enter for default value.
```
Enter author website:  https://vaah.dev
Enter download url: 
```
Enter `true` if you want to run migration for this theme as soon as the theme
is activated else select `false`.
```
Do you want to run migration when activated (true/false):  true
```


Once this step is complete, it will generate a new folder at `VaahCMS > Themes > MyTheme`

Now, you actually activate the theme by visiting following URL:

```http request
<public-url>/backend#/vaah/themes/   
```
or   
login to the backend panel using credentials of the user that was created while the installation of VaahCms.
After that, on the sidebar, click on `Extend` and then click on `Themes`.
