   1. In the first input box we need to pass our `Module` name.
      

   2. In the second input box we need to pass table name or model name or Controller name. 

Example1.   
Suppose you want to create a `Product` Controller for `Order` module, then you just need to provide
these two as inputs in the text boxes provided. VaahCLI will take care of rest and generate the command for you in seconds.
