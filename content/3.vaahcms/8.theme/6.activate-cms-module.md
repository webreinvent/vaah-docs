# Activate CMS Module

------

Now, we are going to add cms codes in our blade file. It is very simple to work with these codes.

First, You need to activate the `CMS Module` by visiting this url:

```
<project-url>/backend#/vaah/modules/
```



Once, the module is activated, you will be able to see the "Cms" menu item in the `Sidebar`. You can click on the menu item and you will see the section of `CMS Module`. For more details, see CMS's [documentation](/vaahcms/cms/introduction)
