# Taxonomies

Taxonomies are an important part of categorizing your site’s content, but the term often confuses beginners because “taxonomy” isn’t something most of us hear in daily life.
In the simplest sense, Taxonomies are just a way to group related posts (or other pieces of content) together. That’s it! Though it’s a big word, it’s not as complicated as it sounds.

For example, if you have a blog about sports, you could create taxonomies for the different sports (football, basketball, cricket, etc.) and assign relevant posts to each taxonomy.

Taxonomies are helpful because they make it easier for readers to find related content (and also provide some context to your content, though that’s a secondary benefit).

##### Default Taxonomy Types

By default, VaahCms includes following types of `Taxonomy`:

1. Countries
2. Registrations
3. Roles

##### Create Taxonomies and Taxonomy Types via VaahSeeder

User can create a taxonomies and taxonomy types through seeds. Create json files of name `taxonomies.json` and `taxonomy_types.json` at `.../VaahCms/Modules/{module_name}>/Database/Seeds/json/` this directory.

`taxonomies.json`

```json
[

    {
        "type_slug": "roles",
        "name": "Backend"
    },
    {
        "type_slug": "roles",
        "name": "Frontend"
    },
    {
        "type_slug": "registrations",
        "name": "Email Verification Pending"
    },
    .........
]
```

`taxonomy_types.json`

```json
[

    {
        "name": "Countries"
    },

    {
        "name": "Cities",
        "parent_slug": "countries"
    },

    {
        "name": "Roles"
    },
    .........
]
```

To run these seeds, you have to add some code in `DatabaseTableSeeder.php` at `.../VaahCms/Modules/{module_name}>/Database/Seeds/` this directory.



`DatabaseTableSeeder.php`

```php
<?php
namespace VaahCms\Modules\<module_name>\Database\Seeds;


use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use WebReinvent\VaahCms\Libraries\VaahSeeder;

class DatabaseTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        VaahSeeder::taxonomyTypes(__DIR__.'/json/taxonomy_types.json');
        VaahSeeder::taxonomies(__DIR__.'/json/taxonomies.json');
    }

}
```
