# Manage Env Variables

Env file contains various settings, one row â€“ one KEY=VALUE pair. And then, within your project code you can get those environment variables with function `env('KEY')`.

The `.env` file stores configuration variables for your application and `.env.example` is simply an example of what might be in the `.env` file! You can easily rename `.env.example` to `.env` to get started.

The `.env` file also contains your app key which is used for encryption in your app. In Laravel, you can maintain separate configuration from your application. For example:- Your local dev environment has different database credentials than production environment. For more detail, view Laravel Documentation.

##### Configure Env from Backend

`VaahCms` provide us different `env` file for different environment or for different `Developers`. You can also create a `env` file of `custom` name. For example:- env.local, env.production, env.username

It will automatically detect your `env` file by App Url. If App url not found then it will fetch `.env` file.

Visit following url you will see the `Env Variables` section:

```
<project-url>/backend#/vaah/settings/env-variables
```

You can `add` and `update` env variables directly from here.

After click on `Save` button, you will see a `Pop-up` that is for confirmation.
